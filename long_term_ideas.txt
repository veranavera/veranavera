Attached bellow are some ideas that I have for near-term, medium-term, and long-term work/expansions to be done on this website

Near-term:
- Add 

Medium-term:
- Add metric/miles options for list pages


Long-term:
- page on displaying vs planting flags
- add long/lat to peaks climbed page
- sort peaks into rough indigenous nations
