    <h1>Essays/Articles</h1>
    <p>
        Here is where I will post links to each of the articles that have been written about me, along with some essays that I wrote in order to further flesh out this project. Currently the articles outnumber the essays since this has been a slow summer writing wise for me, but as time goes on, I think they will make up the majority of the page. I'll try and update the main page for the newest one of each one of these days, but coding and writing take time and as I'm writing this in August of 2024, I'm moving from being burnt out in my job toward a full season of climbing, so it will probably be a while before that happens. In the meantime, feel free to enjoy :P
