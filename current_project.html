    <h1>Southeastern 202 5000ft Mountains</h1>
    <p>
        The current project I'm pushing toward is the 5000ft mountains in the American Southeast, of which there are just over 200 in total! The vast majority of these peaks are in North Carolina, with a few dozen in Eastern Tennessee and a few lying just over the NC-VA border in Virginia. Geographically, this is a rather significant list, as there are only around 20 other peaks in the entirety of Eastern North America that are at least 5000ft tall, with the 57/58 tallest mountains on this side of the continent all being in this region. That being said, I feel like the main significance of this list is that this region is distinctly <i>not</i> one of the trans-positive areas of the country. I loved doing my pride flag project in the northeast last year, and there are a lot of things that need to change in New York and New England to make trans life easier, but at the same time, it's one of the only parts of the country where you'll find pride flags on churches in deeply rural areas. And I love the south, but it's just not as welcoming for trans people. Earlier this year, Tennessee banned drag performances with language intentionally vague enough to effectively ban being trans in public. And although North Carolina has a governor that blocks anti-trans laws, he only got elected after the economic fallout from the previous governor backing a bathroom bill that ushered in the recent era of anti-trans laws. Needless to say, waving a trans pride flag on the tallest mountains here carries a lot more political significance than doing so in New England.

         Now, I say "around" 200, because this is not an institutionally-recognized list in the same way that my previous project was (the 115 is recognized by the AMC). Because of that, everyone has their own arbitrary parameters that they add, and mine were as follows: peaks on the list must have at least 5000ft of clean elevation and 160ft of clean prominence, keeping in line with the standard convention of other peak lists in the Eastern US - of which, 197 peaks in the Southeast meet this criteria. But... it isn't <i>that</i> simple, because this list almost entirely includes the South Beyond 6000 Club list, which is a pretty-well recognized peakbagging project in the area (it was originally going to be the project I was gonna do down here before I expanded it). However, this list has an additional requirement, which is that every peak also have 0.75mi of saddle-isolation, which means that there are five additional peaks that lie on the 6000fter list that aren't on the 5000fter list. To fix this inconsistency, I arbitrary added these five peaks (Roan High Bluff, Hallback, Tennet, Cattail, and Gibbs). If you're worried about topographical inconsistency in lists out east, then I'd like to introduce you to *almost any other list* in this area. Now, many of these peaks lie on private land, and I will have to get permission to hike those peaks for this project since I don't want to test private property laws in the rural south while waving a trans pride flag on the summits. For those peaks that I am not able to get permission to hike, I will substitute them for a peak that meets either the optimistic prominence threshold and/or peaks between 5000-5999ft in elevation that meet the additional isolation criteria.
