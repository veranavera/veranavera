    <h1>Southeastern 202 5000ft Mountains</h1>
    <p>
        After completing the New Southeast 202, a list which I totally made up but did nonetheless, I drove to southern New York to start on my next peakbaggin challenge, the Northeast 131. The list was originally conceived as comprising the most prominent peaks in the Northern Appalachians that were not on the Northeast 115 4000fters list. This list streached from the Catskills to the Chic-Chocs, but even during this phase it was still incomplete. For starters, I knew I wouldn't have the logistical ability to go to Newfoundland or Nova Scotia, even though there would normally be several peaks from those provinces on any such list. Additionally, some of the peaks I knew ahead of time I had no hope of doing, like Croydon in NH or Albert in QC due to private property access issues and alpine restoration projects respectively. Nevertheless, I started anyway and banged through several in the Catskills and the Taconics before heading off to Maine. It was here that I lost my phone, and with it my driver's license, which without a physical copy made it impossible for me to legally drive in Canada. Typically I would order a replacement, but I needed to concurrently update my address and get a replacement sent, which was too tricky for me to pull off while living mobile in my van. So after getting a new phone, I jumped to the Adirondacks and Southern Greens before heading to Baxter and ending at Moosilauke, where I worked for the fall, hiking peaks in the Northeast Kingdom and Central NH. As I'm writing this, I just moved back to the Upper Valley and am gearing up to do several winter ascents over the next few months, hopefully by backcountry skiing!

         As for the future, the 131 is a list in flux. I wanted it to be rigid in comparison to the debacle of the 202, and while I did have to abandon most of the Canadian peaks and the higher elevation bushwhacks, the list remains the most prominent peaks in the area that don't require higher-elevation bushwhacking, which I think gives the list value nonetheless. Additionally, I've climbed several dozen other peaks in addition to the list, so as of the start of December, I've already climbed more than 131 peaks in total - so mission already accomplished 202-style (but not 131 style baby). My future plans change constantly, but I'm expecting to get mostly/all done with the list by the end of the summer, at which point I will head out west and start peakbagging out there. As for the specifics of that, I don't fucking know. Until then, feel free to enjoy my little posts here :)
