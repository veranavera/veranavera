    <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
    <p>
        Here is where I will post links to each of the blog posts/essays I intend to upload to my website, covering pretty much whatever I feel like putting on this website that doesn't neatly fall into the style of a trip report. My goal is by the end of the summer to have at least half a dozen pages to link to from here, but we'll see how long I can keep up my adhd focus on these sorts of things. Currently this website has no back-end, so I'm gonna have to manually add links to this page as I go about my business - hopefully I'll learn how to have the computer generate this page eventually!
