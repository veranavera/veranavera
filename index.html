    <h1>Vera's peakbagging shenanegans</h1>
    <p>
        Hey friends! My name is Veronica Ashcroft (she/her), though I'm also known by my nickname, Vera! I'm a transgender hiker and aspiring mountaineer who does a lot of peakbagging. My signature project is my efforts to take a transgeder pride flag up as many mountains as I can! Last year, I hiked my flag up 115 separate mountains in the Northeastern USA 4000fters list, and this spring, I'm working my way through the Southeastern USA 5000fters list (202 mountains in total)! If you wanna keep up with me as I go through this project, feel free to follow me on either my reddit or insta (u/verana115 and @sapphaverana respectively). This website is my attempt to kind-of blog my way though the hikes that I do for these projects, along with other trips that I find myself on that I wanna share. In its current state, the website is pretty basic, but that's okay, because learning takes time! As I spend more time on this website, it will get bigger and better, but for now feel free to enjoy what trip reports I have up! And if you want to reach out to me, feel free to message me on either reddit or insta!

        With the onslaught of these bigoted laws showing no sign of relenting, I see queer people all over wondering what we can do to fight back. And to be entirely honest, hiking a pride flag up a bunch of mountains probably isn't the most efficient use of my time and energy right now in that political context. It would probably be a much better idea for me to join one of the many political groups and organizations fighing back against this. And I know for a fact that some people will look at my project and be dissapointed that I'm chosing not to do that. But honestly, hiking makes me really happy, and I've spent the majority of my life <i>profoundly</i> unhappy dealing with issues like depression and gender dysphoria. And now that I'm in a position where I can actually do something like this, I'm gonna, because for most of my life I couldn't even imagine myself having a choice like this. And, although I'm well aware that the scope of my project is ultimately small in the grand scheme of things, I've had enough people both online and irl come up to me and tell me that my projects helped inspire them, or at least just brought some trans positivity in an era that is increasingly frightening for queer people. Or to put in another way: I was gonne be out here hiking anyway, and adding the pride glag aspect to my hiking projects allows me to do something good for my people, even if it's not that big.
