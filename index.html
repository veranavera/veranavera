    <h1>Vera's peakbagging shenanegans</h1>
    <p>
        Hey friends! My name is Veronica Ashcroft (she/her), though I'm also known by my nickname, Vera! 
        I'm a transgender hiker and aspiring mountaineer who does a lot of peakbagging. My signature project 
        is my efforts to take a transgeder pride flag up as many mountains as I can! Last year, I hiked my 
        flag up 115 separate mountains in the Northeastern USA 4000fters list, and this spring, I'm working 
        my way through the Southeastern USA 5000fters list (202 mountains in total)! If you wanna keep up with 
        me as I go through this project, feel free to follow me on either my reddit or insta (u/verana115 and 
        @sapphaverana respectively). This website is my attempt to kind-of blog my way though the hikes that I 
        do for these projects, along with other trips that I find myself on that I wanna share. As I spend 
        more time out this website will get bigger and better, but for now feel free to enjoy what trip 
        reports I have up! And if you want to reach out to me, feel free to message me on either reddit or insta!
    </p>
