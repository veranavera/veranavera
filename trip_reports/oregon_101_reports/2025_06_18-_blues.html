    <h1>Blue Mountains: June 18th-</h1>

    <p>
        After the challenges of May, I took a while to get myself back on track toward hiking, since stress takes time to recover from both emotionally as well as physiologically. Anyhow, I eventually made my way out ot the Blue Mountains and climbed Fields Peak. After that...

    <h2 id="fields">Fields Peak, June 18th</h2>
    <p>
        Fields was one of the peaks I wanted to do the previous fall, but couldn't since the access was closed for wildfires. I considered doing it in November but I judged it too challenging for where my body was at with the snow and whatnot. Then I camped at the campground before the dirt road two nights before this and didn't climb due to poor sleep. So you can understand my excitement when I finally climbed it! I took a wrong turn at the second intersection leading up to the trailhead and ended up parking my van and biking up some rough roads up to the trailhead, and was frustrated a little ngl. Although on the bike back there was some pretty significant erosion that might make accessing the trailhead challenging in a sedan - although it is just that one section and I would expect them to regrate a road like this. Anyway, the hike up was delightful and I meandered my way up at about half the pace I'm used to as I get myself into shape for the summer - although my descent speed is the same, go figure. I ended up walking up the meadow to the summit to avoid some snowbanks on the northeast slopes. Fantastic views all around, would recommend
