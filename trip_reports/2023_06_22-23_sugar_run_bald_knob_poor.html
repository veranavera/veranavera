    <h1>Sugar Run Mountain, Bald Knob, and Poor Mountain: June 21st-22nd, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="sugar_run">Sugar Run Mountain, June 21st</h2>
    <p>
        For Sugar Run, I approached Big Horse Gap from the South and then drove out the North along 663, with the entire length of the road being doable in a sedan. Hopping up the summit road lands you in a radio station with no views, but it is an easy ascent

    <h2 id="bald_knob">Bald Knob, June 22nd</h2>
    <p>
        For Bald Knob, I headed up through the summit road from Mountain Lake, which is pretty overdeveloped but which did have flush toilets. Bald Knob would have a good view if it wasn't for the incessant rain, but whatevs.

    <h2 id="potts_mountain">Potts Mountain, June 22nd</h2>
    <p>
        I drove along 613 from Mountain Lake toward the AT pulloff. The walk up was pretty straightforward, and the road leading up to it was doable in a sedan

    <h2 id="poor_mountain">Poor Mountain, June 21st</h2>
    <p>
        Poor Mountain you can drive all the way to the summit gate about a quarter mile from the summit, with the entire length of road being doable in a sedan.
