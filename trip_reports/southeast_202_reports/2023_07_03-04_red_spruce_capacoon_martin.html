    <p>
        From Kennison Mountain trailhead you can take the alrighty-maintained trail to the summit, with some beautiful ecology along the way :)

    <h2 id="red_spruce_knob">Red Spruce Knob, July 3rd</h2>
    <p>
        From Red Spruce trailhead you can take the well-maintained trail to the summit, with some beautiful ecology reminiscent of the 6000ft+ elevations down south and the 3500ft+ elevations up north, which is to say, pretty :)

    <h2 id="thorny_flat">Throny Flat, July 3rd</h2>
    <p>
        There's a ski resort on the top of this mountain. Well, not the *tippity top*, but seeing as I don't care to get to the *tippity top*, I got my photos at a beautiful outlook, with some fantastic hair! Well worth it imo. At the summit I updated my car insurance after finding out it had lapsed earlier that day, luckily nothing happened, but that could have been real fucking shitty - thankfully it wasn't!

    <h2 id="guadineer_knob">Guadineer Knob, July 3rd</h2>
    <p>
        Guadineer Knob is drivable nearly to the summit up Public Route 27, with the final 50ft being walkable on a maintained trail. There's an outlook farther beyond if that strikes your fancy, but I already had spectacular views on Thorny Flat, so I was content to move on to Spruce Knob
    </p>

    <h2 id="spruce_knob">Spruce Knob, July 3rd</h2>
    <p>
        There are many reports on Spruce Knob, so all I'll add is saying it appears all road approaches are on paved road, and my dumbass tried to go up one route on less than a quarter tank, and had to turn around, get gas, and then went up another way. Nice views and my final southern P2k!!! :)

    <h2 id="cacapon_mountain">Cacapon Mountain, July 4th</h2>
    <p>
        Cacapon I did from the State Park Mountain Outlook Road, walking along a gated access road to the summit, which is towered and with not-really-real views

    <h2 id="martin_hill">Martin Hill, July 4th</h2>
    <p>
        Martin Hill is drivable to the summit along Blankey Road and Martin Hill Road, with both being easily doable in a sedan. No views at the summit, but with some good views along the drive up!
