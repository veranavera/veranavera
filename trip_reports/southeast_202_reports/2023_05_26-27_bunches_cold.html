        Rather than trying to park in Mile High Campground, I pulled off on a flat section of the parkway and rode my bike along the dirt roads leading to the summit. Do note that the summit itself is along a poorly-maintained path, and you'll get better views from the campsites. Ten minute trip

        I went from Polls Gap along Hemphill Bald Trail to knab these three, having to do a brief bushwhack for each. Overall those bushwhacks were delightfully pleasant, with each being a simple ramp through open woods, often with heard paths leading up and down each. Unfortunately for the long term, it looks like there might be some development on the private side of Buck and Little Bald, but fingers crossed those developers fail

    <p>
         I drove right to the end of the pavement on the parkway, pulled off, and went up the side of Cataloochee Balsam. The hike was very reminiscent of bushwhacking any 6000fter in the smokes, with it reminding me the most of Guyot. I was fucking pooped by the end of it, but that was because it was my third trip of the day, so there have you

    <p>
        Cold Mountain I did via the Art Loeb trail and its spur from that camp on the western side. The trail was well maintained and honestly I feel it had some of the best views in the entire Richland Balsam Range, personally. Well worth your time
