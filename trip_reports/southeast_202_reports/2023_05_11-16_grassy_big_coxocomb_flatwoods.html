    <p>
        Going back to Carvers Gap was a nice little snapshot for me for the seasons, since this is where I started back in late March - still just as beautiful! I took the AT up Round and Grassy Ridge and honestly it was one of the best hikes I've done int he entire southeast! Absolutely fantastic views with a well-maintained trail.

    <p>
        Unaka was originally supposed to be the first peak I did as part of this project, but I decided against it when I couldn't be sure of a view - a good call, as it would turn out. I went up 197 to the gap at 4000ft and drove up tht dirt road to a pulloff at a hairpin turn at 4700ft, a brief hike on the AT got me up to the summit, and after some delightful conversations with thru-hikers, I made my way back down and spent the night on the ridge. No views but a nice hike nonetheless.

    <h2 id="big_bald">Big Bald, May 12th</h2>
    <p>
        This was the first "real" hike I've done since my backpacking in the smokies a month ago! I say "real" because it was an all day hike with >3000ft of elevation gain and >14 miles, which isn't a big hike, but definitely is much more in line with what I am used to coming from the northeast. Anyhow, the AT from 19W brought me up High Rocks with no issues, and then up to Little Bald, where I could finally catch a glimpse of the main summit. Big Bald does have some great exposed areas near the summit, I just had the misfortune of only showing up right at the point where the storms rolled in, and as soon as I was back in the trees the rain subsided - great luck, but I had it coming after so many good weeks of weather. Hike down I was able to cut over from the High Rocks-Little Bald col over to a USFS road which allowed me to avoid the extra elevation on the ascent!

    <h2 id="coxocomb">Coxocomb, May 14th</h2>
    <p>
        After a much needed rest day I headed up to the Big Bald Trailhead and parked my van before starting up Ogle Meadows Rd, which, although marked as private, is entirely unposed/gated up until 4800ft, where there is a gate and posting (and nowhere to pull off, so you'll probably have to go from the trailhead). The bushwhack along the USFS line was alright, and I was able to link back on the road when it was in the boundary before traveling along some faint paths from the road up the ridge to the summit area - do be warned, this goes within eyesight of a house with a dog just off the ridge. A nice summit area and a delightful descent, though nothing I would call views tbh.

    <h2 id="blue_knob">Blue Knob, May 14th</h2>
    <p>
        I followed the detailed trip report of Jason Newman for this one, which was the only report online when I did this. Basically parking at the community garden was no problem, although I did leave a note just in case, the road walk up is entirely unposted and has some cool things here and there - a culvert and a little man-made pond. Unfortunately my phone was on the verge of death so I couldn't get photos of the summit area, but if you just follow the roads leading toward the summit you'll be fine (there aren't many on the mountain)

    <h2 id="flattop">Flattop, May 16th</h2>
    <p>
        Today was going to be Mitchell Range Traverse day, but it was just not the right conditions for me, so instead I headed over to Flattop, where I took the AT up from 19W and the n bushwhacked along an old roadbed to the uninteresting summit area. Worth it if you're doing P1ks, but otherwise probably not.
