    <h1>Hanging Rock, Rich Mountain Bald, Elk Knob, Snake Mountain, and Three Top Mountain, March 29th-30th</h1>

    <h2 id="hanging_rock">Hanging Rock, March 29th</h2>
    <p>
        For Hanging Rock, I drove down to the end of Rocky Top Trail, which is located on the eastern side of the ridge and which ends at a blue water tower and the start of some state lands. There's enough room near the water tower to park 2-3 cars, and I would recommend parking next to the tower as close as you can so that other cars can use the rest of the space to turn around. From here, I started to ascend the ride and found a well-trodden heard path. The first part is steep, but eventually you make it to a nice outlook and continue on the ridge. The last 0.2 miles is practically a bushwhack, as I was unable to find a clear path forward and the vegetation was thick. At the summit itself I got some fantastic views of the Mitchel Range, Grandfather Mountain, Elk Knob, and all the way over to Mt. Rogers in Virginia. Fantastic summit and definitely the best in the area imo (and yes, I'm including Grandfather in that assessment)

    <p>
        For Rich Mountain Bald, I started from Rich Mountain Gap along Rich Mountain Road. Note that the way to both Rich Mountain and Snake Mountain from here lie on Elk Knob Game lands, which are privately owned and which have signs posted forbidding unauthorized access. So anyway, after parking my van on the pulloff just to the eastern side, I jumped the fence and started going up the bald. The first little bit was absolutely delightful, with some fantastic views. Very quickly the Bald became very thorny, and as I'm writing this trip report a week later, I still have visible cuts on my thighs from that ordeal - be sure to wear tough pants. Anyhow, navigationally the way to the summit was quite easy,a nd while the summit itself has modest views, the real scenery is on the ascent. I got back to my van about two hours after starting, and then I camped overnight in the area and never had any issues. Would not recommend during hunting season though for obvious reasons

    <h2 id="elk_knob">Elk Knob, March 30th</h2>
    <p>
        Elk Knob, being a state park with a lot of traffic, is pretty well documented online, so all I'll add is that the trail itself is well maintained and the parking is free (or at least is free when I was there). Great views all around!

    <h2 id="snake_mountain">Snake Mountain, March 30th</h2>
    <p>
        From the parking lot of Elk Knob, I rode my bike down to the entrance and took a right down the mountain to access the Elk Knob lands that lead to the ridge of Snake. It's about 0.1 miles wide, so be careful to stay on state park lands, as it is very easy for the contours to take you off the mountain while you're bushwhacking. The woods are relatively sparse once you get above the bald area, which also has many thorny plants in it. The final ascent to the ridge was very steep, and if you're planning on doing this in the snow I would recommend an ice axe for self-arresting because the slope really is that intense. Nevertheless, once I got on the ridge I could make out a vague heard path which took me to the summit, which was entirely covered. I think it would be a better idea both in terms of views and in terms of ease to hike Snake from Rich Mountain Gap instead of via Elk Knob, but once again do be aware of the hunting issue. Overall mediocre experience imo

    <h2 id="three_top_mountain">Three Top Mountain, March 30th</h2>
    <p>
        I parked at the end of Three Top Gameland Access Road, which is rather self-explanatory. I was able to bike the first 0.4 miles of the trail before walking up the rest of the way. The trail is decent overall, with some blowdowns here and there. The summit is fantastic though, with phenomenal views all around. Additionally, the Southwestern peak also looks like it would be incredible, and under normal circumstances I would do it, but this was my third mountain in one day and it was nearing sunset, so the time just wasn't right for me!
