    <h1>Lane Pinnacle, Snowball Mountain, Craggy Dome, the Pinnacle, and Green Knob: May 9th-10th 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="lane_pinnacle">Lane Pinnacle, May 9th</h2>
    <p>
        Parked at the MST trailhead to the north and walked along the ridge, which had a number of delightful views to the east. Got a photo at the subpeak of Ravens Call and made my way over to the main summit where i met some barefoot hippies who were also living out of a van and whose dog was named "Vera" too! I love meeting people like that

    <p>
        I didn't think I would do Craggy Dome this day, but it was a short hike from Graybeard Mountain overlook, and I headed up. Decently-maintained trail - worse than the MST but nothing out of the ordinary for a backcountry trail. Nice views over the bald vegetation at the top and a beautiful sunset!

    <h2 id="snowball_mountain">Snowball Mountain, May 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Parked at the MST trailhead at the col with the Craggy Area and headed up the trail. No views or anything but a nice little hike!

    <h2 id="the_pinnacle">The Pinnacle, May 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Parked at the Old Mitchell Toll Road and headed up the maintained trail to the summit. Good views at the top, not very notable outside of that!

    <h2 id="green_knob">Green Knob, May 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Parked at the Green Knob outlook and headed along the eastern side of the ridge to the maintained trail to the summit. Good conditions, and a good view from beneath the fire tower - but ya can't get in right now. Nice mini-hike!
