    <h1>Mount Jefferson, Glade Mountain, and Sand Mountain: June 19th-21st, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="mount_jefferson">Mount Jefferson, June 19th</h2>
    <p>
        For Jefferson I drove up the State Park Road right up to the trailhead 300ft below the summit, and took the wide, gradual trail to the summit, which I had to myself due to the weekday cold rain combo. Could have been a nice view

    <h2 id="glade_mountain">Glade Mountain, June 20th</h2>
    <p>
        For Glade I started from the 647 trailhead at 3200ft and went along the AT over Brushy and Locust. I had heard that Glade Mountain Road was closed to AT hikers due to a dispute about usage, and although I wasn't able to conform/disprove that, there were no cars at the trailhead, nor places to park, so I wouldn't count on that access. Regardless, the cold rain hike was a trip, but I got to the top alright and got back under the infinite tree-rain. Could have been a good hike with better weather, but it wasn't. Oh well, it is what it is

    <h2 id="sand_mountain">Sand Mountain, June 21st</h2>
    <p>
        For Sand I took the trail up from the Virginia DWR trailhead, which requires a fee you can purchase online. The trail was honestly overgrown and the bushwhack had more open woods tbh, although that was pretty brief. Once again, lots of rain
