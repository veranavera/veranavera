    <h1>Guyot Backpacking Loop, April 11rd-13th</h1>
    <p>
        After learning some hard lessons from my previous Clingman's Dome backpack, I was ready to take on my second big backpack in the Smokies: a loop from Baxter Creek up Sterling, Big Cataloochee, Guyot, Pecks Corner, and Cammerer, along with the peaks in and around each of those summits. It too was supposed to be a 4 night backpack, with the caveat of this time I did a much better job packing snacks and choosing which meals would be best. That, plus I dropped almost ten pounds from my pack compared to last time, which gave me a lot of confidence in my ability to do this. It ended up being two nights, however, due to factors that you'll read about. But even though my planning/preperation still wasn't good enough to execute the original route, it was still a whole lot better than last time, and I think that I have finally learned my lesson - either make it a one-nighter or suck it up and pay for a bunch of dehydrated meals, plus pacing myself better. Anyhow, enjoy!

        I started off my parking my van at the Cammerer parking area, since that's the only place it seemed right to leave my van for a couple nights without causing any issue. That area has a bright streetlight over the trailhead, so if you're worried about having your car get broken into, this might be a good place to put it. Anyhow, I hiked along the road to Big Creek Trail and was having a great fucking time - the trail is very well maintained and has a gradual incline which took me from 1800ft to 3000ft without me really registering any elevation gain. After breaking at the junction with Swallow Fork Trail, I started up that one, which was overall a decent trail, but which has some overgrowth for the first quarter-mile or so. Finally I got up to Sterling Ridge, and it was here that I realized I had to make a decision about which peak to push for, since I had limited time and energy. I eventually decided to go for Sterling over Indian Knob because I was still scarred from trying to bushwhack on my previous backpack with my 50lbs pack, even though I would have been totally fine to head over. The woods from the ridge to Indian knob look pretty sparce, so the bushwhack shouldn't be too much of a problem for anyone who knows what they're doing. The Benton MacKaye Trail to Sterling was pretty nice, and the views from the fire tower were good, but the top of the tower is rusted and structurally iffy - I didn't linger long there. Going over to Laurel gap was a nice traverse, with me getting there right at sundown. I was able to befriend a few thru-hikers on the Benton MacKaye and had a delightful campfire with them as they described extensively their subsistence potato and spinach growing projects - to the point of one of them having plans to build a second basement just to store his potatoes. Those are the kind of people I love to meet out here.
