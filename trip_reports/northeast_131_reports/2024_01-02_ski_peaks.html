    <h1>Ski Peaks: January-February, 2024</h1>

    <h2 id="burke">Burke Mountain, January 16th</h2>
    <p>
        Nearly a month after my first attempt at Burke, I finally got a proper skinning setup figured out, and what better a mountain to redeem myself on than the one that had caused me such a fuss earlier? So I drove up to the Mid-Burke Lodge with the intention of buying an uphill pass and skinning up. Turns out, you can only buy tickets at the base of the mountain, and I was pretty unwilling to go through the effort of skiing 500ft down a green only to skin back up and <em>then</em> go up, so I just raw-dogged it. In retrospect, as an employee of another ski area, I could have gotten that ticket for free anyway, but still, unless you're also an employee of another area, remember to start at the base. The skin up only took two hours flat, and the ride down was fantastic, big fan of this mountain. I didn't attempt to climb the fire tower but it would have been a great (and very cold) view if I did!

    <h2 id="paine">Paine Mountain, February 4th</h2>
    <p>
        This mountain is the most obnoxious mountain I have ever climbed in my five years of experience. Not the hardest, not by far, as at least the craggy overnight ascents of Agiochook and Bold, or the extended backpacks up Kuwahi or Emory, to the ultra-long single day trips up Lafayette or Attakulla each had something to offer in their own right. Hell, even when my stupidity makes a trip hard like in the case of White Cap or Nettle Creek, there's still some consolation for me that at least <em>I</em> was the root of the issue. But with Paine, this was not the case - the mountain is obnoxious. You can read my previous failed attempts at Paine on their peakbagger reports, and I won't repeat any of that here, but suffice to say, I had thought I had this mountain figured out, and that approaching with the right gear would make everything okay. It didn't

        I backcountry skied up the hiking trail from GMFP, and actually had a good time on teh compacted snow right up until the first switchback after the pond, where I had discovered that people like to drive their trucks/ATVs/side-by-sides through the snow, creating a very thin layer of snow platform with deep ruts on either side, these continued right up until the spur to the summit, and were very frustrating to ski in. The way to the summit had a good tread (in the snow) but a terrible corridor, and on the way down I left my skins on to avoid whacking my face going too fast. After this, I went along the ridge till I found a leanto that I presume the people driving their cars and ruining the snow on the trail were going to. Great views there, and I started down a foot-path which led me to buttslide through some thick short spruce with my skis - an experience that involved me taking off my backpack to squeeze through the openings

        Upon loudly groaning at the trail and startling some nearby skinners, I proceeded along the ridge to get to the abandoned ski area, only to entirely lose the trail along the way (terribly blazed, no discernable corridor). Eventually I decided to skin down a waterbed which was a fascinating experience of bushwhacking backcountry skiing. I cried loudly at one point until I heard a dog bark and, not wanting to concern its owners, shutted up. Getting back to the trail and actually skiing down the rest of the way was kinda fun, but wow, this mountain should be waaaaay easier than it is for a low-elevation mountain with a "maintained" trail to the summit. The only other time I've failed to summit a mountain twice in a row before successfully doing so for the first time was Magnificent in the Chugach, which at least I got the pleasure of finishing a ten peak loop on it the third time I tried it. There was no triumph here, only Paine. No one I've talked to has ever heard of this mountain, and given my animosity toward it, I hope it stays that way
