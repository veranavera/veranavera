    <h1>Traveler Range: August 21st-23rd, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="south_branch">South Branch, August 21st</h2>
    <p>
        South Branch started with a delightful ford and the trail up was quite nicely maintained, after a brief outlook on the ridge up, the next views you'll get are on Black Cat, which has fantastic views. The trail down from Black Cat is pretty poor in comparison, but the hike along the lakeside is quite nice.

    <h2 id="the_traveler">The Traveler, August 22nd</h2>
    <p>
        The Traveler is a well-documented peak, so all I'll add is that you should not attempt this hike in Crocs, for although my ankles were strong enough to make it through, most's wouldn't be, so bring boots baby

    <h2 id="sugarloaf">Sugarloaf Mountain, August 23rd</h2>
    <p>
        Sugarloaf was one of the nicest mountains I've ever done, with a fantastic view of the Katahdin Range and some delightful scrambling, would highly recommend for anyone in the area

    <h2 id="mars_hill">Mars Hill, August 24th</h2>
    <p>
        After having my car break down on the way to Chase, I drove back up to the mountain and my van went into limp mode, and so I drove over to Houlton to get it repaired since I didn't fully trust my previous mechanic after he worked on it, only for it to only get a few miles before going into limp mode. Anyway, this gave me the chance to go hike Mars Hill, which was a very hot ascent but which had some nice views toward the top. Definitely better to skin up this in the winter than to hike it in the summer, but oh well
    </p>

    <h2 id="chase">Chase, August 26th</h2>
    <p>
        Finally I approached Chase a third time from the north this time, and was able to hop up and down the trail uneventfully. There would have been a view at the summit, but alas it was cloudy on top. Oh well, still a nice peak
    </p>
