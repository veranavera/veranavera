    <h1>New York and the Northeast Kingdom</h1>

    <p>
        After recovering from my sickness and climbing most of the peaks on Ossipee, I decided now would be a good time to work on finishing off my New York Fire Towers along with clearing up some peaks in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. I got five days off from my job and I was originally going to finish the fire towers along with the Lake George 12sters, but I still had to rebuild my hiking abilities, so I only climbed 4 of the 8 mountains I was planning, but it was still good and I finished the fire towers!!! After spending a few nights with Mara and working, I ...

    <h2 id="crane">Crane Mountain, July 8th</h2>
    <p>
        Crane mountain is one that I did in the fall of 2020 when I was living in Wevertown, and I was looking forward to doing it again now that I've transitioned. Now that this one is out of the way, save Cube in NH and a subpeak of Fuji in Japan, there is no sifnificant peak outside of Alaska that I did before I transitioned that I haven't done since then. The way up was steep as shit, being reminiscent of Little Spencer in Maine, but with ladders instead of handlines - that is to say, steep. The view at the top was delightful and the last panoramic view of the Adirondacks I think I'll have for many years, which gives me mixed emotions. I love this place and consider it a home of mine, and it just feels a little sad to let that go even though I'm being called to go out west. It feels chiche, but I genuinely feel likt my time here is limited, and my destiny lies somewhere else, at least for a few years. Nevertheless, it was nice to go out with a bang on this one :)

    <h2 id="gore">Gore Mountain, July 9th</h2>
    <p>
        Gore was a mountain I tried to do back in 2020 when I was living near North Creek, and I remember getting to within spitting distance of the summit and getting annoyed at the road and the fog before turning around. I was debating going up from the ski area, cutting off a few hundred feet of elevation gain in the process, but I figured the steep slopes and exposed sunlight would do more harm than good - a wise assessment. It was hot, it was humid, it was rainy, and those things would have sucked outside of the woods. The Shaefer trail is in good condition, especially since I met a crew corridor clearing it on the way up. The summit is alright but honestly worse than other ski mountain fire tower peaks - Burke, Killington and the lot. Overall a decent mountain though!

    <h2 id="wakely">Wakely Mountain, July 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Wakely was one of two mountains that I wanted to do back in April that had roads closed to the trailhead, the other being Pillsbury. I made the assessment at the time that the snowpack would probably be too much to pack out myself in April. Honestly, looking back I probably would have been okay, but I think it was the right call to make regardless. Anyhow, the road to this trailhead is easily doable in a sedan, and the trail is well maintained. The summit probably had good views in the tower, but there was distant thunder and I didn't want to take my chances in an open metal compartment on top of a mountain in those conditions - I like to live

    <h2 id="pillsbury">Pillsbury Mountain, July 11th</h2>
    <p>
        Pillsbury was one of two mountains that I wanted to do back in April that had roads closed to the trailhead, the other being Wakely. I made the assessment at the time that the snowpack would probably be too much to pack out myself in April. Honestly, looking back I probably would have been okay, but I think it was the right call to make regardless. The road to the trailhead is easily doable in a sedan - to include military road. Sometimes people say a road needs 4wd and you can't tell if they're a city slicker who's full of shit or someone who knows what they're talking about. People talking about Military road to this trailhead saying it needs clearance are city slickers who are full of shit - the Cowpens effect. Anyhow, the trail is well maintained and it was nice to finish on a delightful mountain. 33/33 New York fire towers baby!!! This is the fourth major official list that I've done as part of my projects so far, and I can't wait to soon finish my next one!
