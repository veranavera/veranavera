    <h1>Sams Point, Ashokan High Point, Overlook Mountain, Tremper Mountain, Red Hill, Balsam Lake Mountain, and Huntersfield Mountain: July 9th-July 10th, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="sams_point">Sams Point, July 6th</h2>
    <p>
        Sams point was interesting because to me, this feels like the northernmost southern peak, while Elk Hill, which I did earlier that day, felt like the southernmost northern peak. Oh well, you pay the parking fee at the state park and walk up the road where you get a delightful view before walking along the plateu to the true summit, which is on Carriage Rd. A solid start to the New Northeast 131!!!
    </p>

    <h2 id="ashokan">Ashokan High Point, July 7th</h2>
    <p>
        Ashokan High Point, which for some reason is just called "High Point" in the peakbagger database, is a delightful hike up a maintained NYSDEC trail that takes you through some cool woods up to the ridge, and then scrambles a little bit up to the summit outlook. A nice peak that I would recommend to anyone in the area!

    <h2 id="overlook">Overlook Mountain, July 8th</h2>
    <p>
        Overlook is a fairly-well documented peak, so all I have here to add is some pictures!

    <h2 id="tremper">Tremper Mountain, July 8th</h2>

        Tremper is a fairly-well documented peak, so all I have here to add is some pictures!

    <h2 id="red_hill">Red Hill, July 9th</h2>
    <p>
        Red Hill is a fairly-well documented peak and also the first fire tower in the Catskills I've encountered that isn't open for the public - you can climb up it but can't get in the top room (at least the day I did it!)
    </p>

    <h2 id="balsam_lake">Balsam Lake Mountain, July 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Balsam Lake Mountain is fairly-well documented, so all I'll add is that it definitely feels higher-elevation in a way I haven't felt since WV!

    <h2 id="huntersfield">Huntersfield Mountain, July 10th</h2>
    <p>
        For Huntersfield, I started from Huntersfield road from the western side of the ridge and followed the well-cleared but muddy ATV path to the summit. Getting to the pulloff on the ridge can easily be done in a sedan. Near the summit there's a leanto and a view, which is rather nice!
