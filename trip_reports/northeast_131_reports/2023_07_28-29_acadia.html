    <h1>Bald, Cadillac, Western, Ragged, and Megunticook: July 28th-July 29th, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="bald">Bald Mountain, July 28th</h2>
    <p>
        Bald Knob I accessed using the hiking trail to the south/west of the ridge, which involved basically walking up a granite slab for a mile to get there. Nice views along the way, and nice views just off the summit, but definitely a lot of development going on up there

    <h2 id="cadillac">Cadillac Mountain, July 28th</h2>
    <p>
        Cadillac is a very well-documented peak, so I'll just add that you should park at the entrance and take the free bus to the trialhead of your choosing - don't drive, it's too expensive

    <h2 id="western">Western Mountain, July 28th</h2>
    <p>
        Western was the polar opposite of Cadillac, it's a wooded summit with a trailhead on a dirt road with a cul-de-sac at the end, and I saw two other people my entire hike. I loved it. I was struggling because it was mountain number three that oppressively hot day, but I managed to make it through. There's a nice outlook just off the summit for people who want views, would definitely recommend over Cadillac for that reason alone!

    <h2 id="ragged">Ragged Mountain, July 29th</h2>
    <p>
        Ragged was a delightful hike up from the trailhead on the western side, with a well maintained and gradual trail leading up to a summit with delightful views - would recommend!

    <h2 id="megunticook">Megunticook Mountain, July 29th</h2>
    <p>
        Megunticook is a very well documented peak, so I'll just add that your admission to the park also allows you to cross the highway and take a shower in the bathhouse near the shore, just in case y'all want to!
