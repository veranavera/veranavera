    <h2 id="hurricane">Hurricane Mountain, April 13th</h2>
    <p>
        This mountain, more than any other mountain in recent memory, gives me "classic Vera" vibes when thinking back to my first (and most difficult per hike) project of the Northeast 115. Maybe it was being in the high peaks again, but it just felt so natural and I really enjoyed the experience. Hurricane is a well documented peak so all I'll add is that there is that rainfall contributes significantly to the swampage early on in the hike. Other than that, I can see why this one is such a popular mountain!

    <h2 id="swede">Swede Mountain, April 14th</h2>
    <p>
        Swede was a pretty straightforward hike that I went up after spending the night at a nearby highway pulloff. Not too much to say other than the organization that maintains this, like that for Buck, takes the spirit of NYSDEC trail maintenance - especially as it relates to drainage!!!

    <h2 id="thomas">Cat and Thomas Mountain, April 14th</h2>
    <p>
        I was originally planning on doing this as a mini-traverse, parking my car at the Cat Mountain Trailhead and then biking up to Thomas, but I wanted to conserve the charge on my eBike for Vanderwhacker the following day, since I've been having electricity woes for the past few weeks and can't just charge it from my van's rig (thank you shitty manufacturing at Renogy). Anyhow, the loop was straightforward and not too difficult despite the extra 300' of vertical. Nice views on both of the 12sters on this loop!

    <h2 id="vanderwhacker">Vanderwhacker Mountain, April 15th</h2>
    <p>
        Back in the fall of 2020, after I had finished my first round of the 46, and after I had done all the 4000fters in the Catskills and Vermont, I was searching for something to do for the last two weeks I had before I moved back to Alaska for the winter. Vanderwhacker was one of the hikes I did, on one of the first snowy days of the year. I remember being blown away by how wonderful the views up top were, and the rest of the hike was honestly pretty great too. Suffice to say, I was looking forward to my second go at the mountain as part of the Fire Tower challenge - along with being a 131er on my list. I knew that the road was out to 28N, but I was encouraged by the lack of snow I had seen on Hurricane - virtually none up to a few isolated patches past 3300ft. Additionally, I knew that most of the trail was on the south side of the mountain, so hopefully the exposure to sun would replicate the conditions I saw north of the High Peaks. I figured I would give it a shot with biking on the flat and then going up the (hopefully fully thawed) trail
    </p>
    <p>
        As always, fate doesn't give the slightest fuck what encourages me. Somehow Vanderwhacker had more snow at 1600ft than Hurricane did at 3000ft - and that only got worse with elevation. I only got about 60% of the way along the road before having to stop due to low battery on my bike - I made the right call by doing a Thomas loop the day before. The road is totally bikable, and maybe the snow hides some tread problems, but I'm honestly not sure why they closed it up. Thehiking trail was swampy but tenable up to about 2500ft, where it turned into a narrow stream with a lot of overgrowth and treedowns. I can't help but wonder if the flooding that inspired them to close the road also halted regular maintenance on the trail. Anyhow, the blowdowns didn't help. Silly me forgot to take my gaiters, and so when I postholed continuously past 3000ft, I cried several times. Somehow I managed to pull it together for the photos, but I was no happy camper. Also it was raining the entire time, did I mention that? I had a much worse experience this second time around, but at least I know in better conditions this is a good mountain
