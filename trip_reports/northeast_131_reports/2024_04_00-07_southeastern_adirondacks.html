    <h2 id="kane">Kane Mountain, March 31st</h2>
    <p>
        After spending the night at the trailhead for Kane, I started up the northwestern trail, and found it to be characteristically muddy, but with a gradual incline. The summit tower would have obviously had good views, but I was too tired to be bothered to go up on account of rolling out of bed, scarfing down some cereal, and going up. With that in mind, I headed down and took the rest of the morning easy

    <h2 id="spruce">Spruce Mountain, March 31st</h2>
    <p>
        After some R&R in a Stewart's parking lot, I went over to the trailhead of Spruce, curious to see if the mountain road I saw on maps would be a viable way to bike up the mountain. There exists a road, but it looks like it's part of a private snowmobile trail, and although none of the postings said "no trespassing", there were enough signs saying "no ATVs" that I can't imagine the owners would like people biking on the road. Oh well, the trail was bog-tacular, but requiring no spikes at any point. The fire tower at the summit was closed to the public, but the door to the top section was wide open, so you could totally get away with climbing up. Me? I was too tired and too weary of the wind chilling me to go up, but keep that in mind for the near future: you can physically and easily climb up it. The way down was uneventful. Counting Upper Esopus, Spruce is the halfway point for me for the New York Fire Towers: 16/32!!!

    <h2 id="hadley">Hadley Mountain, April 1st</h2>
    <p>
        After a night of terrible sleep at the trailhead for Hadley, I started up and found the tread to be characteristically abysmal, but the incline to be manageable. An absolutely spectacular series of views at the top, and the fire tower here has the benefit of having the glass in-tact, although I must caveat that the glass is blurry, so you'll have to open the one window that swivels facing the high peaks. Regardless, the way down was delightful, and I spent the rest of the day resting in Lake George, deciding where to climb the following day, and where to take refuge in the impending snowstorm
