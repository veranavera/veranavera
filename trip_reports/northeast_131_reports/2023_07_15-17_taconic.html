    <h1>West Kill, Everett, Grass, and Equinox: July 9th-July 10th, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="west_kill">West Kill, July 14th</h2>
    <p>
        West Kill was supposed to be the start of a loop including Hunter and Rusk, but I very quickly discovered that my body simply wasn't there for it, even after a rest day. So I just did West Kill, but I got some good photos out of it!

    <h2 id="everett">Everett Mountain, July 15th</h2>
    <p>
        Everett I walked up the AT from the start of the dirt road to the north, which is closed to vehicles this year. Still, a quick little hike to a peak with some good outlooks!

    <h2 id="grass">Grass Mountain, July 16th</h2>
    <p>
        For Grass, I followed the trip reports advising you approach it from Black Hollow Road, and I found the initial part of the road to be a little too muddy for driving up, so I parked just before the sign declaring the road a public access route. I had no problems parking there and even overnighted in my van without issue. Once you hit the ridge you quickly go from a road to a hiking trail, and while you can absolutely get to the ridge in an ATV, I absolutely disagree with the notion that you can drive all the way up - the corridor just isn't wide enough. But on the ridge you get a nice outlook. The summit has no views, but that's okay, the hike was still cool!

    <h2 id="equinox">Equinox Mountain, July 17th</h2>
    <p>
        For Equinox I took the Blue Trail up from the eastern side, and got no view at the top due to wildfire smoke. For those who would consider taking the road up, know that there is a lot of christian imagery on the summit building, and that by paying the fee you'll be funding that - just so that no one unintentionally funds something they don't believe in!
