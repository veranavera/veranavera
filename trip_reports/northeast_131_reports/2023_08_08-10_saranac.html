    <h2 id="baker">Baker Mountain, August 8th</h2>
    <p>
        Baker is a well-documented peak, so all I'll add is that parking seems limited, so be aware of that!

    <h2 id="saint_regis">Saint Regis, August 9th</h2>
    <p>
       Saint Regis is a well-documented peak, so all I'll add is that the trail fucking sucks, it's a bog nearly the entire way. Fuck NYSDEC lack of funding/poor management of their trail maintenance cause this is one of the most popular ones in the entirety of the state
    </p>

    <h2 id="cathedral_rock">Cathedral Rock, August 9th</h2>
    <p>
        Cathedral Rock was a simple walk up from the Ranger School area, which has the parking area nested inside next to the field. There's signage but it can be confusing, so take a left at the fork and then a left again and you'll get there
    </p>

    <h2 id="bear">Bear Mountain, August 9th</h2>
    <p>
        Bear Mountain trailhead requires you enter into a day use campground with an eight dollar fee, but you can get a free shower out of it. Overall nice trail, though I think the view is on the south-side trail, because the summit is entirely wooded. Whaevs

    <h2 id="arab">Arab Mountain, August 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Arab mountain is a straightforward hike up and down, with some nice overlooks near the fire tower
    </p>

    <h2 id="goodman">Goodman Mountain, August 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Goodman was a straightforward hike with the first half mile being a paved path in the woods, good views at the summit and a nice sign at the trailhead underscoring who the mountain was named after

    <h2 id="coney">Coney Mountain, August 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Coney was another straightforward hike with a good view, it's a junior 29er for a reason after all!
