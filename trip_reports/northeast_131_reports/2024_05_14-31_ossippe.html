    <h1>Ossipee and Sons</h1>

    <p>
        After starting my job at the start of May, my current peakbagging took a back seat to earning money for future peakbagging, and it didn't help that there were about half a dozen minor issues with my van that started up in the final week in the Adirondacks. After going over to the Greens to bushwhack up Farr, I shifted focus over to central NH, and starting cranking my way through the Ossipee 10 with a loop on the western side of the range.

        Farr is a peak I'd been aiming to do for over a year, and when I was looking for a P1k semi-near the upper valley that I haven't done yet, it was pretty much the only option open. Driving over with Mara, we started up the Long Trail from Brandon Gap about 3.5 miles until bushwhacking the open woods up to the summit which, thanks to some blowdowns, has some nice views towards the east. We were the first to sign the summit register since August, so that was fun. And it was Mara's first bushwhack - and they liked it!!!

    <p>
        The original plan for the 21st and 22nd was to do Bayle and then a loop from Bald Knob to Roberts the first day, and then do a loop around the main peak of Ossipee to knock out all ten peaks on the official list. However, this was the first hot week of the year, and after slogging it through ninety-degree heat and a heavy thunderstorm over 12 miles, Mara and I decided to take a rest day and come back for these peaks later. The hike itself was alright, and we were joined by another friend for the first part of it before she had a mild allergic reaction to all the bug bites! She was fine but definitely didn't want to continue. The bugs kept bothering us the whole time, although it did get better as it cooled for the rainstorm. Overall a decent hike
