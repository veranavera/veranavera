    <h1>Bald Area: October 5th-9th, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="pisgah">Mount Pisgah, October 5th</h2>
    <p>
        Pisgah was a straightforward hike from Long Pond Road, and the foliage made it well-worth my time. A longer hike than I was expecting, I still got some delightful outlooks

    <h2 id="haystack">Mount Haystack, October 5th</h2>
    <p>
        Haystack was a short and sweet hike for me starting from the southern trailhead on Long Pond Road, and I got an unintentional sunset hike, which was delightful

    <h2 id="bald">Bald Mountain, October 6th</h2>
    <p>
        Bald was a real slog for me, as I was for some reason fucking exhausted, but ultimately the trail wasn't too bad and there is a nice shelter at top. Afterward I had to shelve my plans to do Hor the day after, but whatever

    <h2 id="black">Black Mountain, October 1st</h2>
    <p>
        For Black Mountain, I started up from Howe Hill Road, and enjoyed the maintained and publicly-accessible trail all the way to the summit, which had some delightful views of Moosilauke, Clough, and Jeffers
