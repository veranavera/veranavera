    <h2 id="plymouth">Plymouth, September 22nd</h2>
    <p>
        Plymouth was a pretty straightforward hike from the trailhead along Old Hebron Road. There's a lookout along the way up but I didn't bother with it

    <h2 id="stinson">Stinson, September 22nd</h2>
    <p>
        Stinson was a delightful hike for me starting from the Stinson Mountain Trail on Doetown Rd. There's also an ATV road that parallels the hiking trail, but honestly it wouldn't save you any trouble to do that one instead. Overall a delightful hike!

    <h2 id="carr">Carr, September 23rd</h2>
    <p>
        Car I approached from the west at the Three Ponds Trailhead and enjoyed the gradual hike which felt like the first higher-elevation peak I'd done in a while, which is true as it was three weeks since I had done white Cap. Honestly, kind of some views at the top toward Moosilauke if you stand atop the old firetower foundations, but I understand why this was taken off of the 52

    <h2 id="blueberry">Blueberry, October 1st</h2>
    <p>
        Blueberry was a delightful hike for me, this time approaching from the north side, which I enjoyed better and which I think it shorter and less elevation as well. Anyway, some wonderful views of Moosilauke, which is quickly becoming my favorite mountain :D
