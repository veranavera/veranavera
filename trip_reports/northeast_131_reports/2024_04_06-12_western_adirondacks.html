    <h1>Western Adirondacks: April 6th-April 12th, 2024</h1>

    <h2 id="blue">Blue Mountain, April 6th</h2>
    <p>
        After redeploying from Lake Placid on the afternoon of the 5th, I tried to find a trailhead around Blue that would be safe for the night, with the snowfall expected to continue. I couldn't find one, and I figured that I would rather take the risk of an encounter with law enforcement than risk being stuck for a day in the snow. So I parked right on the side of the highway during a snowstorm, and despite a number of cars and plows coming by, I ended up alright - my theory is whatever state troopers went by that night took pity on me. Regardless, I started up Blue right after a pair of snowshoers and a quartet of skiers. Good powder at the start devolved into much thicker snow by the descent, and in either case, being the first person to pack out the trail for bareboots, it was a challenging ordeal for me. But, I got to the summit and got not a smidge of a view. Oh well, I got back down and went over to Long Lake for the afternoon

    <p>
        For Owls Head, the trailhead is pretty good for overnighting at - at least in comparison to Blue. After a much more relaxing night, I started up the trail and, while I appreciated the pack-out-ness of the trail, the slush was very thick and good footing was hard to come by. Regardless, the view from the top was fantastic, with a clear line of sight to Blue, Kempshall, and several other minor peaks in the area! The way down was uneventful, and I once again crashed in Loon Lake for the afternoon, noting the increase in people from the day before

        I read something recently that stated that, on average, a total solar eclipse occurs for a given area about once every 400 years. I don't know if that's true or not, but it does lead me to wonder: in what context will this eclipse where I am now be placed when the next one happens? 400 years ago these lands were Haundenosaunee, and while the Haundenosaunee remain here despite efforts by the settler-colonial regime to wipe them off the land, those efforts have fundamentally transformed the area into a state entirely out of step with the rest of the history of the Adirondacks. For dozens of eclipses prior, a way of life existed here that had its own rich traditions, continuities, and relationships with the land - some of which we are aware and some of which have been lost to time. I wonder how many people here throughout the centuries experienced an eclipse and found the same beauty and awe in the spectacle that I do today. I wonder how many of those people took comfort in knowing that, in the future, their descendants would get to experience that same beauty and awe. I wonder how those people would feel if they knew what would happen to their land and their descendants - if they knew that they would never get the same experience as they did. I wonder things like these a lot. I wonder what will be of the land and the Haudenosaunee for the next eclipse here. I wonder if the nightmare that is the settler-colonial regime of the United States will have gone the way of Rhodesia or Apartheid South Africa. I wonder if this will be rightfully restored Haudenosaunee land. I wonder if the horror that has preceded this eclipse in this area was a blip on the historical radar, or if we are headed into an even darker future. I wonder, because I cannot know. Not just because of the fact that I can't know the future, but also because, as a white person, I can never understand the gravity of this disposession, nor grasp the depths of this injustice - nor will I pretend to. But if my imagination is worth anything, I'd say it was - and is - one of the greatest crimes I'm aware of.

        I was awake most of last night thinking about this and other things. I often wonder if what I do - take a trans pride flag up mountains - is even an appropriate thing to do. I constantly have to tell people who respond online to my project not to use terms like "conquering" or "claiming" to describe what I do - and it feels sometimes like I'm fighting the weight of decades of colonial mountaineering on my own. There's a more modern tradition of climbing and displaying flags at summits that I seek to promote, as I feel like an authentic expression of personal identity and accomplishment will always be a better framework in which to act than a vain declaration of ethnic conquest and triumph. And although I, and many other climbers, seek to promote that new framework - the old one remains entrenched in peoples minds. Doing what I do, am I reenforcing that old framework every time I don't emphasize the new one? Every time someone sees what I do and doesn't explicity say "conquering" or "claiming", do they just walk away thinking that's what I intended? Am I continuing to do harm when people think that? Fuck, should I even be here at all? Is it even appropriate at all to recreate on land taken in genocide? Is it even appropriate at all to recreate when that genocide is continuing? Should I even be writing this paragraph talking about my own white guilt when there are far more important things to be said on this matter, when there are far more indigenous voices and opinions to be listened to before my own? Should I just shut the fuck up? I honestly don't know, and I fear that my willingness to go ahead and do these things when I don't have answers to these questions speaks to some deep moral inadequacy on my part - and I also know that thinking like that is directly detrimental to the goals of Indigenous rights in this county. Indigenous people don't need white people crying about how guilty they feel, they need white people supporting the fight for an end to the genocide and the restoration of that autonomy and agency that was stolen. Yet here I am, not on the picket line or sabotaging a pipeline, but gleefully recreating on their stolen land - only speaking out to people I know irl and writing on my silly little blog.

        I'm aware that no one person can fight every injustice, and that if you focus yourself on more than one or two causes, you end up stretching yourself too thin to be of any use. But I'm also aware that what causes we choose to fight for and how says a lot about ourselves - and sometimes I wonder if I chose wrong by picking "trans visibility in the outdoors". I'm gonna keep doing what I do, because I've had enough people over the years tell me how valuable they find if - even if on a very small and personal level. And because, I really enjoy it. If I wasn't taking a flag up these mountains, I would still be climbing them just the same, and I figure that adding a little sprinkling of positivity on top makes it more worth while. Ultimately it's up to you to judge what you think of me and what I do, and if your disapproval is for almost anything outside of transphobia, I'll understand and probably agree in a certain sense. The mind is a complex thing, and I'm still figuring out my own.

        As for the events of today, I tried to camp out at the Goodnow Trailhead last night, and got told by a guy at 10:30 that I wasn't allowed to since it's private property. To his credit, he gave me directions for somewhere to camp, and I was able to sleep alright on land for the Santinoni State Forest. I got back to the parking lot at around 7:00, and lingered there until around 11:30 as more and more people showed up ready to hike for the day. When I got up to the summit, I found it to be a relatively good place to see the eclipse, but there were far too many people. Upon suggestion of a friendly guy who gave me a pair of eclipse glasses, I went to a rocky outcropping about a quarter mile from the summit along the ridge. It was here where I got my photos. After hanging out sunbathing for an hour, I noticed it had gotten colder and the eclipse was already halfway through! Right before totality, about ten people joined me on the outcropping, but they were friendly and I didn't mind it. I eventually got my photos and was not disappointed. For sure, with more planning and space I could have gotten some better photos - to say nothing of having a photographer and/or better equipment, but for a selfie on a mountaintop with only two and a half minutes to get it right, I don't think I did too bad of a job. This was the third eclipse in my life and my first totality as a woman, and I was not disappointed by the experience :)
