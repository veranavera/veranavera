    <h1>Dorset, Peru, Stratton, Berlin, and Greylock Mountains: August 12th-14th, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="dorset">Dorset Mountain, August 12th</h2>
    <p>
        Dorset Mountain I was planning on doing with its subsidiary western peak, but I forwent the second part of that due to not wanting to bushwhack, a pretty reasonable thing considering it was August - although the woods did look open. Overall nice trail up approaching from the ATV road from the south, and some nice views alongside where the fire tower should be
    </p>

    <h2 id="peru">Peru Mountain, August 13th</h2>
    <p>
        For Peru I approached via Styles on the Long Trail, and found it to be pretty straightforward as a result. A nice view at Styles if you get it on a good day, but nothing of the sort on Peru

    <h2 id="stratton">Stratton Mountain, August 13th</h2>
    <p>
        For Stratton I approached via the Long Trail from the south, and it was pretty straightforward. No views at all except on the fire tower on top, which was rather delightful!

    <h2 id="berlin">Berlin Mountain, August 14th</h2>
    <p>
        For Berlin I approached via the old ski trail on the north side of the peak, which was quite steep and not too enjoyable with me gaining 1200ft in a mile. The summit of Berlin was a beautiful callback to the southern balds I've grown to love over the course of the year, with the vegetation being quite similar

    <h2 id="greylock">Greylock Mountain, August 14th</h2>
    <p>
        Greylock I approached from the Gould Trail, which was gradual and well maintained. Some nice views at the summit area. No fees to hike this trail or park your car at the trailhead
