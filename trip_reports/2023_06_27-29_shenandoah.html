    <h1>Shenandoah Mountain Peaks: June 27th-29th, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="trayfoot_mountain">Trayfoot Mountain, June 27th</h2>
    <p>
        For Trayfoot, I parked at the Blackrock trailhead and headed up and over toward the main peak. Blackrock is a sick fucking peak, Trayfoot a little less so, but it is trailed, so that's nice.

    <h2 id="big_flat">Big Flat Mountain, June 28th</h2>
    <p>
        Big Flat has a campground at the summit, so I just drove up and down. Probably views somewhere, but I knew I would get better ones later in the day.

    <h2 id="hightop">Hightop Mountain, June 28th</h2>
    <p>
        For Hightop, I started from the north trailhead and headed up the AT, which was gradual and switchback-y, just like you would expect.
    </p>

    <h2 id="hazeltop">Hazeltop Mountain, June 28th</h2>
    <p>
        For Hazeltop, I hopped along the AT from the overlook just to the north, which wasn't that much of an overlook. The AT is, well, the AT.
    </p>

    <h2 id="hawksbill">Hawksbill Mountain, June 28th</h2>
    <p>
        Hawksbill I had first done december of 2019 while I was on winter break for college. That day it was a pristine view with no one around, since apparently many don't like to hike on cold weekdays in December. Whatever. This time the wildfires continued to ensconce the view, and there were many folk around. Oh well, still some nice rocks!

    <h2 id="stony_man">Stony Man, June 28th</h2>
    <p>
        Stony Man was another one I had done back in 2019, and this peak was far less touristy and imo had a better view, and still just a little hop up!

    <h2 id="the_pinnacle">The Pinnacle, June 29th</h2>
    <p>
        For the Pinnacle I headed up from the AT from the south, and I feel like a broken record, but it was about what you would expect.
    </p>

    <h2 id="hogback_mountain">Hogback Mountain, June 29th</h2>
    <p>
        Hogback has the best view at the overlook, but the walk up the road is pretty straightforward and relatively unnotable.
    </p>

    <h2 id="north_marshall">North Marshall, June 29th</h2>
    <p>
        North Marshall had a good fucking view, and was definitely the best peak I did in Shenandoah imo. Worth it
