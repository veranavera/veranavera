    <h2 id="grandfather">Grandfather Mountain, March 27th</h2>
    <p>
        There are many, many descriptions of Grandfather Mountain out there, so I'll just plug here that I traversed the ridge from the Linville trailhead and found it to be challenging and enjoyable. It felt like the cliffside trail on Mansfield with the popularity of Monadnock for you northeasterners - or Old Rage for you Virginians. Anyhow, here's a photo dump

    <h2 id="sugar">Sugar Mountain, March 27th</h2>
    <p>
        Sugar Mountain is a ski mountain with a lot of development on top of it. I was originally planning on biking up and down one of the runs, but I was surprised to find that the runs were still operational into late March - good for them. Instead I drove to the col between Sugar and Flattop and biked to the summit. Since I was parked totally illegally I didn't linger long, and although the summit itself was rather nice, it was right next to housing for rich assholes. The photos I got were fantastic though, and I made the rather difficult decision to post some of the ones that make my body look not the way I've always wanted to. It can be really hard to look at a photo of yourself and see an image you don't love - I experience it all the time with gender dysphoria. Even though I used to have an eating disorder, it wasn't body image issues that fueled it, but rather the fear of losing control over myself. And when I look at those last few photos and see myself, those memories are unlocked. And honestly, it's probably body dysphoria at that point because I am objectively not-fat. And even if I was, who the fuck cares? Just existing as a trans woman already defies gendered expectations of presentation - and that's before I get covered in mud all the time. And even if some fucking chud out there says it's for "health and fitness reasons", they can go fuck themselves, cause I just climbed 9 mountains in just over 48 hours, and I'm about to do another two hundred before the end of the spring. God, I fucking hate people like that
