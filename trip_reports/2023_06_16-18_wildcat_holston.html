    <h1>West Wildcat Top, Pinnacle Mountain, Holston High Top, and Rich Knob: June 16th-18th, 2023</h1>

    <h2 id="west_wildcat_top">West Wildcat Top, June 16th</h2>
    <p>
        After spending the night at the Camerer Trailhead, I set off to Green Corner Road to park at the AT intersection at 1700ft, which was dirt road up to that point, but 100% doable in a sedan. Hiking up the AT was delightful, although it did rain on me pretty hard for about 5 of those minutes. The summit of West Wildcat Top, also called Snowbird Mountain, is a FAA broadcast center, with a bald area just along the AT just below the summit. Fantastic views of the Eastern Smokies, and a nice final-view of the NP just before I head up north!

    <p>
        For pinnacle, I drove up Dry Creek Rd and then FS 188, which is a dirt road doable in a sedan, but with some big potholes here and there - so be careful! The road is gated past 3000ft, and I hiked up the last 300ft and found a  delightful fire tower with some beautiful views of Unaka and the other Tennesseean peaks in the area! Nice sunset views too!

    <h2 id="holston_mountain">Holston Fire Tower and Holston High Top, June 18th</h2>
    <p>
        For Holston, I drove up FS56 and FS202, where I hopped up a logging road up to the Fire Tower before realizing that wasn't the true peak! So I drove further along the ridge and found it! Neither peak is that cool, but if you're brave enough to climb the fire tower I imagine there are some views

    <h2 id="rich_knob">Rich Knob, June 18th</h2>
    <p>
        I decided to camp at the AT this night, and saw a giant meadow to my north, and decided I had to hike it. Good decision, a nice beautiful meadow with great views of surrounding ranges, and I ended up pushing to Rich Knob, which is a tiny little bushwhack though open woods after jumping off the AT. Delightful hike, would recommend
