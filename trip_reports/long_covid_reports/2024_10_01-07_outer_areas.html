    <h1>Outer Areas: October 1st-October 7th, 2024</h1>

    <p>
        After climbing all of the immediately-accessible P2ks around Moscow, I started up with the P1ks in the immediate vicinity, with the hopes that I could bridge the gap between the most prominent peaks I did on my roadtrip out west and the least prominent P2ks I did after getting there. The Long Covid List sure is something, but I do what I can when I can. Anyhow, I got to borrow my partner's car to go and knock out two P2ks north of Spokane so that was nice, but overall this was more waiting for myself to get healthier, with mixed results.

    <h2 id="kamiak">Kamiak Butte, October 1st</h2>
    <p>
        Starting from the county campground, we took the most direct route up to the summit, which was a gradual and beautiful wooded trail. The summit area was very beautiful and I'm happy to have gotten out there :)

    <h2 id="hoodoo">Hoodoo Mountain, October 2nd</h2>
    <p>
        I'm not sure why this mountain has this name, and because of that, I'm not sure if naming it "hoodoo" is problematic, but the word itself is not, so I'm going to cautiously use the name - and if there's a reason for me not to, let me know and I'll slap Alaska conventions on it. The most recent trip report said you'd need a new air filter if you drove the last mile and a half of this road due to the sand, which I thought was a cleaver exaggeration. It really isn't. To do this last section, you'll need a powerful high-clearance vehicle and/or 4wd - and do it when it's dry. That being said, the road up to that point is easily doable in a sedan, so just be ready for a sandy hike if you don't like adventure. So ungodly much sand. But my partner's car is exactly that, and I made it all the way up to the summit and took in the wonderful views out to the west

    <h2 id="long">Long Mountain, October 2nd</h2>
    <p>
        For long, I approached via the standard path from the west, which was doable in a sedan up to 3100ft where it becomes a high clearance road. At 3840ft there's a clearing and I'd recommend parking there, although I will say that my short vehicle could have 3 pointed out from in front of the gate - but still, if you have a truck or SUV, park at the clearing. Anyhow, the road hike was nice and the whack up from there was not nearly as fun. Open woods with sharp underbrush made me feel like I should have worn pants. Anyhow, photos at the top were nice and I took a more direct route down from the summit - would not recommend, as there is even more underbrush west of the summit than north of it. Anyhow, I'm happy to to have gotten this one over with

    <h2 id="steptoe">Steptoe Butte, October 6th</h2>
    <p>
        Steptoe has a bumpy but paved road up to the summit and a beautiful expanse of views. I took the chance to wear my new romper to the summit and it turned out nice! I'm gonna try and make an effort to dress up more for my photos on some of these easier peaks because it's so fun to!

    <h2 id="dennis">West Dennis Mountain, October 7th</h2>
    <p>
        For Dennis, I drove on FR337 right up to the base of the peak - the road is doable in its entirety in a sedan. From there I started bushwhacking up the ridge. The woods were open and the whacking wasn't too bad until I found a trail that started about 50ft from where I entered the woods. Should have done more research I guess. Oh well, the trail was delightful, and although there weren't any views up top, the overall experience was nonetheless delightful

    <h2 id="gold">East Gold Hill, October 7th</h2>
    <p>
        For East Gold Hill, I started up Jerome Creek Rd, which is easily doable in a sedan up to the hairpin turn at 4100ft, after which the road becomes higher clearance, although I think a skilled and bold sedan driver could still make it farther up. Anyhow, the road takes you right to 40ft shy of the summit, where an ATV path leads you up the last distance. Some nice views along the road
