    <h1>Outer Areas: October 23rd-November 11th, 2024</h1>

    <p>
        Toward the middle of October, on my third visit to urgent care, it finally became evident that what I was suffering from this fall wasn't a post-viral cough caused by long covid, but a post-viral asthma that may in fact be chronic, since apparently covid can do that to you. Frustrating given that a simple inhaler was all I needed to do my thing, and even more frustrating that the medical-establishment failed me and millions of other people by acting like long covid wasn't real and not adequately informing us of the risks at hand. Yes I'm aware I should have been masking regardless, but as we've seen over the past three years - you can't individual solutions your way out of societal problems. Anyhow, now that I had my inhaler, after a few weeks of walking 7-10 miles a day to start to rebuild my hiking capacity, I climbed Blacktail in Idaho, and had one of the best experiences hiking all year. After this, I headed over to central/eastern Oregon for a bit and racked up a few more hikes out there!

    <h2 id="blacktail">Blacktail Mountain, October 23rd</h2>
    <p>
        Blacktail was the first hike I had done after getting my asthma diagnosed and finally getting an inhaler - the lack of which was the primary reason all of my fall hiking plans fell through this fall. Nevertheless, after a few weeks of walking more and recovering, I was able to march up Blacktail without any issue. Starting form the trailhead on Butler Creek Rd, it was a steady and graded incline straight up to the ridge, although there were switchback cutoffs that you could use if you wanna kill your knees in 30 years. Anyhow, the ridge was fantastic and the summit was easily one of the most beautiful sights I've seen all year - maybe even the most tbh. Well worth it, and a hike needed to help remind me what I'm capable of

    <h2 id="roman_nose">Roman Nose Mountain, November 6th</h2>
    <p>
        The directions to get to Roman Nose are 126 to FR 4390 to Whittaker Creek Rd to Dunn Ridge Rd to Knowles Creek Rd, for which you can find other's gpx tracks online. Those roads are narrow and steep, but also well-paved all the way to within a mile or two of the summit spur, and the dirt section after that is doable in a sedan. The spur road was a nice little hike for me up to a beautiful vista reminiscent of the Southern Appalachian Balds that had captivated me so last spring. Anyhow, got my photos and headed down, and just narrowly didn't have enough daylight to go up Prairie, but did get to see a delightful sunset!

    <h2 id="prairie">Prairie Peaks, November 7th</h2>
    <p>
        Currently West Prairie Peak is considered to be the taller of the two, but it's close enough and easy enough that anyone who does it should also hop up East Prairie as well. Anyhow, the route up was 36 to Horton Rd to Congdon Creek Rd to 15-7-17 to 15-7-23 to 15-7-7, for which you can find other's gpx tracks online. The road is narrow and windy, but paved up to 2400ft or so, after which it becomes a steeper but still well-grated road up to the col between East and West Prairie. That being said, there is a quarry and a gate at 2700ft that "may be closed at any time", so maybe be cautious about when you proceed up. Being a weekday in November and being unsure as to whether or not the road was closed in the winter, I parked and slept at the quarry and got to see both a beautiful sunrise and sunset, and biked up in the morning. The road after the cols is high-clearance but not 4wd, so I would recommend hiking/biking up the rest. ANyhow, beautiful views up both!!!

    <h2 id="marys">Marys Peak, November 7th</h2>
    <p>
        Marys is a well-documented peak with a paved road leading to the trailhead just shy of the summit, so I won't write much here but to say you can see Pah-to all the way to Wy'east and Seekseekqua and maybe on a clear day down to Shasta! Beautiful views!!!

    <h2 id="black">Black Butte, November 9th</h2>
    <p>
        Black Butte was originally going to be a long hike we did from the lower trailhead, but Mara wanted to cut off any distance if possible, and indeed the road was fine all the way up to the upper trailhead. From there, it was a delightful trail up to the summit, with only the last portion having any snow at all. Compared with the mighty volcanos visible from the summit, you could tell Black Butte was decidedly in a rain shadow. Anyhow, this was a beautiful peak and I will be returning to hit the lower trailhead :)

    <h2 id="lookout">Lookout Mountain, November 11th</h2>
    <p>
        The road leading to the trialhead, NF 42, was cleared up to the col between it and round, and it appears it's maintained in the winter? No promises though. Anyhow, we elected to walk up to Mother Load Mine Trailhead instead of walking, even though my fiance's car could have totally handled it. Anyhow, the hike up reminded me why I don't like winter hiking, as there was a fair bit of snow we had to break trail through and also follow one other person's footprints. Anyhow, the view at the summit was clouded in, but the view just shy was fantastic, and the way back was delightful.
