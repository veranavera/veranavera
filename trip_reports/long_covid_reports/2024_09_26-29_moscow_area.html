    <h1>Moscow Area: September 26th-September 29th, 2024</h1>

    <p>
        After killing a few days in Lewiston, I was able to crash at the place my partner is staying at in Moscow for a few weeks as I tried to get my health back. But that's no reason to slow down on peakbagging! So I started by hitting the pair of P2ks close to Moscow, along with Mission. A few days later we went to Spokane to shop, and along the way we got to drive up its namesake mountain, which was delightful. The first hints of colder weather started appearing, and I welcomed them - anything to make my hiking life easier

    <h2 id="moscow">Moscow Mountain, September 26th</h2>
    <p>
        Moscow was a nice road hike up from the gate, which can be easily accessed in a sedan. Eventually the road to the West Peak turns into an ATV path and then heard path up to the summit, with some delightful views there. the road up to the East Peak was also nice, and the views there even nicer. One note though: one of the trees that had fallen on the road but which was bucked by the time we got there was massive, and my partner and I counted the tree rings. Obviously there's a margin of error, but we counted 125 rings! This tree is either from the 1800s or very shortly thereafter! I've never seen a tree that old and was delighted to come across it. The next person who hikes the peak should count the tree rings for themselves and see if my count was good!

    <h2 id="bald">Bald Mountain, September 27th</h2>
    <p>
        Bald was a drive up from the highway, with the entirety of the road being easily doable in a sedan up to the last quarter mile, which is still doable in a sedan, but which may require some careful maneuvering. Anyhow, delightful views from the top

    <h2 id="mission">Mission Mountain, September 27th</h2>
    <p>
        Mission was a drive up from 95, with the entirety of the road being doable in a sedan. An overall delightful experience.
