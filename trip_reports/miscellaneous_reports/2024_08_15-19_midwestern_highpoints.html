    <h1>Midwestern Highpoints: August 14th-August 19th, 2024</h1>

    <p>
        The second half of my roadtrip out west was hampered by a declining health due to my sickness as well as the stress of driving so much and feeling unable to escape the heat - the midwest in August is no joke. Nevertheless, despite these issues I was able to do four more state highpoints and four more prominent and isolation points! By the end of it, I was happy to be at higher elevation with no humidity as I'm now giving myself some time to rest and recover in Northern New Mexico

    <h2 id="richland">Richland Hill, August 14th</h2>
    <p>
        Richland is a simple drive up along the state highway, nothing much to add there!
    </p>

    <h2 id="campbell">Campbell Hill, August 15th</h2>
    <p>
        For Campbell, the college was clearly having a summer high school program that had just ended, so there were dozens of cars picking kids up. Not wanting to weave through these, I parked at the Loves and biked up from there. Nothing much more to add to that tbh - weird that this little hill is one of the most isolated peaks I've ever climbed
    </p>

    <h2 id="hoosier">Hoosier Hill, August 15th</h2>
    <p>
        Hoosier hill is a simple pulloff from the highway in an unusually wooded area in the middle of corn and soybean fields.

    <h2 id="washington">Washington Hill, August 16th</h2>
    <p>
        The highpoint of Washington County requires a walk for the last little bit from the road, which requires you parking in front of a no trespassing sign and in front of someone's driveway. Considering there was a thunderstorm I decided not to go to the tippidy top of the highest point in the area with metal infrastructure abound
    </p>

    <h2 id="pilot_rock">Pilot Rock, August 16th</h2>
    <p>
        Pilot rock from the highway has an old path with cinder block steps leading up the first half of it, with some light scrambling through a notch on the second. Delightful views at the top!
    </p>

    <h2 id="williams">Williams Hill, August 16th</h2>
    <p>
        Williams was a simple drive up, with all but the last tiny bit being a paved road - and the last tiny bit being easily doable in a sedan
    </p>

    <h2 id="taum_sauk">Taum Sauk, August 17th</h2>
    <p>
        I drove up from the highway to the state park and walked that last 0.2 miles of paved path to the summit, which was wooded but delightful!
    </p>

    <h2 id="butler">Butler Hill, August 18th</h2>
    <p>
        The top of Butler County is on a wind farm that has a sign kindly asking not to trespass - a kind of kindness that is kind of ambiguous tbh. Anyhow, this peak is atop a massive grassy expanse that really makes you feel like you've hit an isolated point
    </p>

    <h2 id="sunflower">Mount Sunflower, August 19th</h2>
    <p>
        Sunflower was a long drive up good dirt roads with almost no reception - and windy!
    </p>
