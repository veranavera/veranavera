    <h1>Northeastern Highpoints</h1>

    <p>
        After quitting my summer job and taking a bit to recover from burnout, I set out on my grand roadtrip to the southwest that I had been planning for over a year. During the first half of this, I finished all of the highest, most prominent, and most isolated point in the Northeast save Quirauk and Preston. This was a lot of driving and tge fact that I came down with a sickness for the first part of it was frustrating, but I was able to push through. Hopefully now I can one day return to the Northeast via Quebec and finish up some long-term goals I have before heading down to the Southeast to finish up those long-term goals too!

    <h2 id="burley">Burley Hill, August 10th</h2>
    <p>
        For Burley, I approached via a pulloff on New City Road that was a paved section of someone's driveway - and there was plenty of room there. I would also like to state, for the record, that New City Road is well paved on the Connecticut side, and that approaching from the Massachusetts, the road is paved but in much worse state. Anyhow, I navigated around the person's house and whacked up the thick woods, occasionally following atv paths that line the western side of the mountain. Ironic that my first peak on my trip out west felt like southeast bushwhacking but what can ya do?

    <h2 id="jerimoth">Jerimoth Hill, August 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Jerimoth is well documented so all I'll add is that the parking is a pull off on the highway and there is no joke, virtually zero elevation on the trail, so it should be pretty straightforward!
    </p>

    <h2 id="beacon_pole">Beacon Pole Hill, August 10th</h2>
    <p>
        The top of Beacon Pole is on someone's driveway so I just got my photos a bit farther down along the road
    </p>

    <h2 id="beacon">Beacon Hill, August 11th</h2>
    <p>
        The top of Beacon is on someone's house, so I got my photos a bit farther down. For what it's worth, the ferry ride over and bike ride across Block Island was very nice. I often say peakbagging is a convenient excuse for me to travel places I otherwise wouldn't've, and this is a prime example of that!

    <h2 id="frissell">Mount Frissell, August 11th</h2>
    <p>
        Frissell is very well documented, so all I'll add is that since the trailhead is on the border, you can almost certainly get away with car camping here!
    </p>

    <h2 id="high_point">High Point, August 12th</h2>
    <p>
        High point is well documented, so all I'll add is that the view of the Catskills was delightful!
    </p>

    <h2 id="ebright">Ebright Azimuth, August 12th</h2>
    <p>
        Ebright Azimuth is well documented, so all I'll add is that I think Delaware sucks 
    </p>

    <h2 id="iron">Iron Hill, August 12th</h2>
    <p>
        Iron hill is a quick hop up from a boogie neighborhood, so just be aware that there will be eyes on you
    </p>

    <h2 id="cape_henlopen">Cape Henlopen Great Dune, August 13th</h2>
    <p>
        Cape Henopen's Great Dune was a quick if possibly illegal walk up from the parking area, with nice views and whatnot
    </p>

    <h2 id="wicomico">Wicomico Hill, August 13th</h2>
    <p>
        So the highpoint for Wicomico county, which is the most isolated point in Maryland, is right on a cemetary. Personally I think it's fine to go and take photos, but just be respectful 
    </p>

    <h2 id="davis">Mount Davis, August 14th</h2>
    <p>
        Davis was an easy drive up and had a good view at the top!
    </p>

    <h2 id="hoye_crest">Hoye Crest, August 14th</h2>
    <p>
        Hoye Crest was a simple trail that I was able to bike the first half of - right at the end of the clearing is when that's no longer viable
    </p>
