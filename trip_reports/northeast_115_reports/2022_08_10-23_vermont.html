    <h1>Vermont: August 10th-August 23rd, 2022</h1>

    <p>
        With the temperatures returning to normal summer conditions, I decided to bang out the 4000fters of Vermont, along with a few disparate peaks in the Whites. These trips were comparatively much easier than the slogs, being less distance and elevation gain by a substantial margin, and I ended up doing a lot of them as afternoon/evening trips, as I was still a full-time student for the entire summer and I couldn't skip *that* many classes lmao. I was not a good student

    <h2 id="mozdebiwajo">Mozdebiwajo, August 10th</h2>
    <p>
        Mozdebiwajo is my favorite mountain in Vermont, which is really saying something because usually I'm an insufferable hipster when it comes to disliking the most popular hikes. But honestly, Mozdebiwajo is an exception - it's just so damn beautiful. I started up from Smugglers Notch along the long trail, and made it up to the summit around evening. It was beautiful, but after talking with a Long Trail hiker at the summit, a large family showed up, and being raised in a very christian environment, I'm just very skeptical about the not-bigoted nature of families like that. Maybe that puts me in the wrong, but I've been burned by too many white protestants in the past having a very southern family. Anyhow, I ended up getting my photo on the Adams Apple, a fact that bothered me at the time but is, in retrospect, pretty fucking funny

    <h2 id="killington">Killington, August 12th</h2>
    <p>
        For Killington, I went up the eastern side along the ski area's hiking trails, and meandered my way up in the evening and meandering back down. Honestly this is one of the most forgetful trips of the entire season, so I haven't too much to say - and I probably wouldn't have even writing at the time

    <h2 id="moziozagan">Moziozagan, August 13th</h2>
    <p>
        Moziozagan was the last trip for this project that was also  trip I led for my school's hiking club, so I got to take a quartet up and get some nice photos at the summit, courtesy of a friend from Nebraska. Anyhow, Moziozagan is right up there with Mozdebiwajo in terms of "peaks I really like in the Greens" - and for goo dreason

    <h2 id="isolation">Isolation, August 14th</h2>
    <p>
        After my Boott Spur failure a few weeks prior, I took a shot at Isolation via Rocky Branch, and despite the absolutely terrible reviews I received from friends who had complained vehemently about the poor drainage of the trail, I found it to be above average for the backcountry. Anyhow, the summit ended up being one of my favorite views in all of New Hampshire, and I understand why so many people choose to end their 48 on this one

    <h2 id="jackson">Jackson, August 17th</h2>
    <p>
        Jackson was the last one out for the Agiochook Range, and I charged up Crawford Path up to the summit, with the experience at the bald area being the only time in this entire project, save perhaps Big Slide, where I was at serious risk of hypothermia. We love the whites, folks

    <h2 id="wtf">WTF loop, August 20th</h2>
    <p>
        Didn't do Avalon so it wasn't a WTAF loop, unfortunately. But it was still a decent hike, with most of it being pretty forgettable aside form a nice conversation I had with a hiker atop Wiley overlooking Webster Slide

    <h2 id="owls_head">Owls Head, August 21st</h2>
    <p>
        Owls Head was far less enjoyable for me the second time around as compared to the first time, when I had taken nordic skis and enjoyed the last of the snowpack around Lincoln Woods back in 2020. The blowdowns that had previously yielded such nice views had given way, and now nothing was visible. I think Allen is the far better hike imo, but apparently I'm in the minority on that one

    <h2 id="ellen">Ellen and Abraham, August 23rd</h2>
    <p>
        Starting from Lincoln Gap Road, I took the Long Trail North and did the entire range up to Ellen and back. No views to speak of until a brief relief on the second ascent of Abraham, with the rest being pretty consistent rain. Overall a meh, with my 2020 experience being far better
