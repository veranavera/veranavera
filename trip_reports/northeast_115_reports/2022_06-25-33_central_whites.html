    <h1>Central Whites: June 25th-July 3rd, 2022</h1>

    <p>
        With the bulk of the 46 done and my summer term of classes starting, it was time to focus again on the Whites, with the goal being to finish the whites south of the Kanc and finish out most of the Pemi. I was still in physical recovery from the Adirondacks by the time I started, but I eventually recovered, and was able to get a lot done in short order once July rolled around

    <h2 id="tripyramid">Tripyramids, Whiteface, and Passaconoway, June 25th</h2>
    <p>
        This was the hike that I had planned to open my project with. Unfortunately, my first hike failed for a sum of small reasons, and the second one failed for one large reason, and so they ended up constituting the second third of the experience. This one is a long one, and honestly I don't have much to add to it, except to say that walking along the Kanc for two miles at the end when I was wishing for the heavens to drop me a bike was not fun

    <h2 id="carrigain">Carrigain, July 2nd</h2>
    <p>
        Carrigain was the first trip for this project for which I led a group from my school's hiking club, and had a delightful time. I'll never forget the two boys on our trip, upon finding an extra ball hitch and random rug in the club's van, decided to take these two, along with the main ball hitch and fire extinguisher, up the entire mountain for shits and giggles. I told them several times it would be alright to leave them along the trail and hike down with them later - especially considering one of them had a backpack without hip straps, meaning all of that weight was on his shoulder. Yet they did it anyway - gotta respect it when people commit to the bit

    <h2 id="twin_loop">Twin loop, June 16th</h2>
    <p>
        In a repeat of one of the stupidest trips I've ever done, me and a friend marched up Hale from the Twins trailhead and went over to Zealand, the upper Bonds, and over the twins back to the trailhead in a killer loop. Great company and a great hike, along with some of the best and worst photos of my entire project ngl
