    <h1>Peakbagging projects</h1>
    <p>
        This page is where I have links to each of the peakbagging projects that I have or am currently undertaking. Broadly, these projects can be divided into three categories. The first contains the primary personal projects that I have pursued - lists like the Southeast 202 or Northeast 131. The second contains official and/or objective peakbagging lists that are more well-recognized and that I actively pursue, but which aren't my primary focus as a peakbagger - lists like the New York Fire Towers or the Eastern 2000ft prominence peaks. The third and final category consists of lists that I have a long-term interest in pursuing, but am not in a position to make substantial progress within the next year or so - lists like the US state highpoints or the Catskill 3500ft peaks. This tri-compartmentalization works well within the context of my peakbagging, as I am typically drawn to peaks in a given area that would typically fall on different official/objective lists from one another, and I often bounce around a lot between these different lists - or bounce around doing peaks that lie on no list at all. Thus, each of my personal projects can be thought of as a "superlist" of sorts, with smaller lists being fully or partially contained within. This is why I feel comfortable placing the Northeast 115 in the "personal lists" category, since it is a superlist with it's constituents of the New England 67 and Adirondack 46 being recognized as the official lists on the index below

        As time goes on, this list will get bigger and cooler, but for now, feel free to enjoy what I have. Each list below contains a link to a page enumerating all the peaks on that list, that you can sort by a variety of parameters. For each list in the personal lists category, there is a link to a page describing what the list is and chronicling my experiences climbing said list. For each list in both the active and passive official/objective lists categories, there is a link to the main outside authority on that list. Finally, each list has the number of peaks I've climbed on the list, along with the total number of peaks on the list - which links to a page on this website containing each peak on the list. Most of these lists I've completed, and the ones that aren't I'm likely to complete by the end of the summer. If you notice any bugs/omissions here, let me know! :)
