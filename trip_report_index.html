        <h1>Trip Reports</h1>
        <p>
            As I go on, I will publish detailed trip reports of the hikes I do to this website, full of photos, trail information/conditions, and advice on route finding. Currently this website has no back-end, so I'm gonna have to manually add links to this page as I go about my business - hopefully I'll learn how to have the computer generate this page eventually!
