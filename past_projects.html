    <h1>Northeast 115 4000ft Mountains</h1>
    <p>
        Last year, I hiked a transgender pride flag up 115 moutnains in New York and New England that were on the Northeast 4000fters list. This list is a fairly popular peakbagging project for hikers in the Northeast, and typically takes people several years to work through due to the difficulty and remoteness of these mountains (even if you live smack in the middle like I did, many are still 6+ hrs of driving away.) I was able to do the list in 115 days, which was largely unintentional but quite mathematically pleasing. I'm not going to run through every hike here, or post every photo I have from that project, but rather go through the highlights and try and tell a more coherent story than I was able to over the course of dozens of different reddit posts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the project even started, I had to test the waters to make sure I was able to do it to begin with, so when one of my trans friends asked me to hike Franconia Ridge with them, I decided to take the falg up and give it a shot. And honestly, I got some really good photos out of it!

        After that, I knew it was time to start, and so I decided to formally kick off the project with a rather ambitious 20 mile loop of the Tripyramid range, and I utterly failed at it. I camped out at the trailhead the night before and got shit sleep due to some unusually warm weather and thick black flies, then I started the hike on a somewhat nauseous stomach, which only got worse with heat. Once I was 4.5 miles in I realized that both my boots and my pack were on the brink of tearing appart, I knew it was time to turn back. But not to worry! Cause I came back the next week ready to do a smaller version of that hike, and actually got to summit Whiteface... before being thwarted from Passaconoway by a thunderstorm.

        <figcaption>This was the photo on Whiteface, which was bad because (a) it was taken vertically, (b) I was wearing cloths that didn't bring out my best features, and (c) I still had no idea how to pose properly (May 14)

    <p>
        After those two fiascos, I was starting to seriously doubt whether or not I was even competent enough to hike anymore - much less take on a large peakbagging project. So I decided to try one of the easiest mountains on the list, and headed up Tecumseh in late may. And this time I summited! And it was quite vindicating after failing at my previous two attempts.

        After knocking out about a dozen mountains in New Hampshire, I used a break from classes to spend two weeks in New York hiking! The Adirondacks are one of my favorite mountain ranges, and it was a great time to kick off my second round of the 46!

        After my time in the Adirondacks, it was time to go back to school, as I was taking a full-courseload over the summer - but that didn't stop me from cranking through more mountains!

        Once the quarter ended, I was able to go hit the peaks in Maine, and I was entirely blown away with how great the mountains be up there.

        Honestly, doing this project was one of the coolest and most reawarding things I've ever done, and it gave me the confidence I needed to pursue other projects like this. If you wanna see more photos, just click the google drive link at the end of the page!
