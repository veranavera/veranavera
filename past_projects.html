    <h1>New Southeast 202</h1>
    <p>
        This Spring, after spending three months building out a van that I bought and converting it into a mobile-living space, I set out to climb the tallest peaks of the Southern Appalachians: the 202 5000fter mountains. I felt like this was a worthy successor to my original list of the 115, and that the somewhat localized nature of these peaks would allow me to put down some roots in the western NC area. Welp, neither of those two things happened. The list of the 5000fters is good, but unfortunately flawed in several key aspects. Firstly, several of the peaks lie on private property, and while I have no ideological problem passing by a "no trespassing" sign, I can't just turn around and post about it online, thereby making my dislike of private property laws a moot point. Secondly, many of the peaks are only accessible by bushwhacking, which, I discovered, it not my favorite passtime, especially when I'm bushwhacking in the late spring/early summer, which happened a fair amount. Thirdly, for those peaks that do have maintained paths to the summit, many are roads, thereby making me more likely to drive up more of the way or take a bike up, neither of which I see an issue with, but which purists of peakbagging would galk at
    </p>
    <p>
        I made it about three weeks before I adjusted my peakbagging goals from the 202 500fters, to a list of the 100 highest and 100 most prominent peaks in the south, with a few more 5000fters thrown in there for good measure. However, the most prominent peaks brought in way more challenges than the highest, and so eventually this list would be bastardized into the current iteration: the New Southeast 202. This list contains all of the South's 6000fters and P2ks, along with a large number of additional 5000fters and P1ks, plus some other mountains randomly thrown in there for good measure. There's no rhyme or reason to the list, and there are still private property peaks that you'll have to ask permission on, and paths you'll have to bushwhack for yourself, but I promise you, the list is doable, and contains some of the most spectacular peaks I've ever climbed. I highly doubt anyone will ever pursue my list, but my hope is that someone may look at it and decide to hike one or two of the mountains on it near where they are - but a girl can only dream
    </p>
    <p>
        As for how I accomplished this, broadly speeking, I started in western NC before going on a big loop around northern GA, AL, TN, KY, and the westernmost part of VA. Then I descended back into the NC area for another while, then another smaller loop through GA and TN, before heading up the Blue Ridge Parkway till Shenandoah, passing into West Virginia, before finishing up the list in Pennsylvania, a move which I have had to defend, as many people are unaware of the topographical regions of the Appalachians which loop the Catskills in with the mountains of West Virginia and which loop the Taconic Range in with the mountains of Newfoundland. Pennsylvania is, topographically speaking, part of the Southern Appalachians, and I will die on this hill
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyhow, even though I constantly changed the list I was pursuing, I found the New 202 to be rewarding and I was really happy that my project was able to reach more people. I think the best part of this project was that I now feel like I've done 95% of what I want to do hiking in the South, which opens the door after I finish the 131 to head out west and stay there for several years, which is a prospect I'm strongly looking forward to. Feel free to enjoy some of my favorite flag photos from this project :)

    <h1>Northeast 115 4000ft Mountains</h1>
    <p>
        Last year, I hiked a transgender pride flag up 115 mountains in New York and New England that were on the Northeast 4000fters list. This list is a fairly popular peakbagging project for hikers in the Northeast, and typically takes people several years to work through due to the difficulty and remoteness of these mountains (even if you live smack in the middle like I did, many are still 6+ hrs of driving away.) I was able to do the list in 115 days, which was largely unintentional but quite mathematically pleasing. I'm not going to run through every hike here, or post every photo I have from that project, but rather go through the highlights and try and tell a more coherent story than I was able to over the course of dozens of different reddit posts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the project even started, I had to test the waters to make sure I was able to do it to begin with, so when one of my trans friends asked me to hike Franconia Ridge with them, I decided to take the falg up and give it a shot. And honestly, I got some really good photos out of it! 
    </p>

        After that, I knew it was time to start, and so I decided to formally kick off the project with a rather ambitious 20 mile loop of the Tripyramid range, and I utterly failed at it. I camped out at the trailhead the night before and got shit sleep due to some unusually warm weather and thick black flies, then I started the hike on a somewhat nauseous stomach, which only got worse with heat. Once I was 4.5 miles in I realized that both my boots and my pack were on the brink of tearing apart, I knew it was time to turn back. But not to worry! Cause I came back the next week ready to do a smaller version of that hike, and actually got to summit Whiteface... before being thwarted from Passaconoway by a thunderstorm.

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        After those two fiascos, I was starting to seriously doubt whether or not I was even competent enough to hike anymore - much less take on a large peakbagging project. So I decided to try one of the easiest mountains on the list, and headed up Tecumseh in late may. And this time I summited! And it was quite vindicating after failing at my previous two attempts.

    <p>
        After knocking out about a dozen mountains in New Hampshire, I used a break from classes to spend two weeks in New York hiking! The Adirondacks are one of my favorite mountain ranges, and it was a great time to kick off my second round of the 46!

        After my time in the Adirondacks, it was time to go back to school, as I was taking a full-courseload over the summer - but that didn't stop me from cranking through more mountains!

        Honestly, doing this project was one of the coolest and most rewarding things I've ever done, and it gave me the confidence I needed to pursue other projects like this. If you wanna see more photos, just click the google drive link at the end of the page!
