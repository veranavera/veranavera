    <h1>Long Covid List!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks I've climbed and brought a trans pride flag to the top of as part of my Long Covid List that I did in the late summer and fall of 2024 (<a href="page_of_long_covid_list.html">which you can read about here</a>). Each peak is linked to its page on peakbagger, along with its elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happily correct their names!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. Currently, the default is sorting by prominence, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
    </p>
