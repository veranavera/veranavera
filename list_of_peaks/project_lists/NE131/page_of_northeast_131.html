    <h1>New Northeast 131</h1>

        <i>***This page is a description of this peakbagging project, including both an explanation of the list itself as well as a bit of the story behind how it went and some nice photos!!!

        After completing the New Southeast 202, a list which I totally made up but did nonetheless, I drove to southern New York to start on my next peakbagging challenge, the Northeast 131. The list was originally conceived as comprising the most prominent peaks in the Northern Appalachians that were not on the Northeast 115 4000fters list. This original list stretched from the Catskills to the Chic-Chocs, but even during this phase it was still incomplete. For starters, I knew I wouldn't have the logistical ability to go to Newfoundland or Nova Scotia, even though there would normally be several peaks from those provinces on any such list. Additionally, some of the peaks I knew ahead of time I had no hope of doing, like Croydon in NH or Albert in QC due to private property access issues and alpine restoration projects respectively

        Similarly to my saga the previous spring in the Southeast, I climbed for about a month before running into two substantial issues that caused me to rework the list. Firstly, I lost my phone for most of the summer, and with it my driver's license, which given logistical issues and a limited hiking season made it impossible for me to hike the Canadian peaks on this original list. Secondly, most of the bushwhacking peaks proved untenable due to the dense vegetation at higher elevations in the Northern Appalachians. The result was that the list shifted in two stages to it's current form: a list of 131 1000ft prominence peaks in the American Northeast. Along with the minor additional peaks I climbed during this time, this list stretches from the Finger Lakes to Acadia, and includes every sub-4000ft P2k in the American Northeast, along with many peaks that lie on prominent elevation-based, views-based, and fire-tower based lists

        As for how I tackled this project, I started anyway and banged through several in the Catskills and the Taconics before heading off to Maine. It was here that I lost my phone, and with it my driver's license, which without a physical copy made it impossible for me to legally drive in Canada. Typically I would order a replacement, but I needed to concurrently update my address and get a replacement sent, which was too tricky for me to pull off while living mobile in my van. So after getting a new phone, I jumped to the Adirondacks and Southern Greens before heading to Baxter and ending at Moosilauke, where I worked for the fall, hiking peaks in the Northeast Kingdom and Central NH. The winter saw a predicted slow-down in peakbagging with most of the peaks I climbed being in and around the Upper Valley, but the early spring saw me climb a substantial number of peaks in New York. As I am writing this in May, I am once again working in the Whites, and hope to finish the list by the start of September - though tbd based on how life goes

    <!--As for the future, the 131 is a list in flux. I wanted it to be rigid in comparison to the debacle of the 202, and while I did have to abandon most of the Canadian peaks and the higher elevation bushwhacks, the list remains the most prominent peaks in the area that don't require higher-elevation bushwhacking, which I think gives the list value nonetheless. Additionally, I've climbed several dozen other peaks in addition to the list, so as of the start of December, I've already climbed more than 131 peaks in total - so mission already accomplished 202-style (but not 131 style baby). My future plans change constantly, but I'm expecting to get mostly/all done with the list by the end of the summer, at which point I will head out west and start peakbagging out there. As for the specifics of that, I don't fucking know. Until then, feel free to enjoy my little posts here-->

         As for the future, the 131 is a list in flux due to there being over triple the number of P1ks in the northeast than that particular number. But as of May, the list is mostly-fleshed out in New York and Eastern Maine, with around 40 peaks remaining to climb in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Western Maine. My assumption is that by the end of the summer I will have climbed a total of around 250 peaks as part of this project - including the sub-P1k peaks, of course. This would bring the total number of peaks I've climbed out east to over 600, which is a substantial achievement. Of course, a lot of these peaks still need to be climbed, but I think I've demonstrated that, as long as I am physically and financially able, I'm committed to my little peakbagging projects ;)
