    <h1>New England 67 4000fters!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks on the New England 67 4000fters, a list that I hiked as part of my Northeast 115 peakbagging project in the summer of 2022, and which, as part of that project, I took a transgender pride flag to the top of each of these peaks!!! This is an official list that is very-well documented, but I relisted it here for your convenience! Each peak is linked to its page on peakbagger, along with its elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happy correct their names!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. When linked from the outside, the default is to sort by prominence, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
    </p>
