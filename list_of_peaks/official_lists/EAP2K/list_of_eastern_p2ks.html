    <h1>Eastern USA 80 2000ft Prominence Peaks!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks on the 80 2000ft prominence peaks in the Eastern USA, a list that I have hiked as part of all three of my eastern peakbagging projects from the summer 2022 to the summer of 2024, and which, as part of that project, I took a transgender pride flag to the top of each of these peaks!!! This is an objective list that is well documented, but I relisted it here for your convenience! Note that I still have one peak on this list (Elephant), but every other peak I have done! Each peak is linked to its page on peakbagger, along with its elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happily correct their names!!!

        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. When linked from the outside, the default is to sort by prominence, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
