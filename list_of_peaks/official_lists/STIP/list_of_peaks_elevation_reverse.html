    <h1>State Isolation Points!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks that I have climbed as part of my peakbagging projects that are the most topographically isolated points in the states they reside!!! As part of these projects, I took a transgender pride flag to the top of each of these peaks!!! I've only included the ones I've climbed so far, but as time goes on, I hope this list will get bigger and bigger!!! Each peak is linked to its page on peakbagger, along with its elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happy correct their names!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. When linked from the outside, the default is to sort by prominence, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
