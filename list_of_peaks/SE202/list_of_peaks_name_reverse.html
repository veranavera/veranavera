    <h1>New Southeast 202!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks I've climbed and brought a trans pride flag to the top of as part of my New Southeast 202 peakbagging project in the spring of 2023 (<a href="">which you can read about here</a>). Each peak is linked to its page on peakbagger, along with its elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Note that some of these peaks I did as part of my project, but don't meet the various prominence thresholds to be part of the main list - these peaks are unranked on this webpage. Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happy correct their names!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. Currently, the default is sorting by prominence, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
