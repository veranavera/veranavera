    <h1>Vera's Rhode Island Peaks!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks in the state of Rhode Island that I've climbed and brought a trans pride flag to the top of since August 2024, with each peak linked to its page on peakbagger, and with the elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Currently, the list is quite small, but one day I might come back and add additional peaks, so stay tuned for that! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happily correct their names!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. When linked from the outside, the default is to sort by elevation, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
