    <h1>Vera's Climbed Ultras!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the ultra-prominent peaks (i.e. peaks with 1500m/~5000ft of prominence) that I have climbed since starting my trans-pride flag projects back in the summer of 2022!!! Ultras are regarded around the world as one of the highest classes of prominence, and many peakbaggers dedicate their climbing careers to bagging as many as they can. Thus, these mountains represent the most valued mountains that I've climbed so far, and they represent the mountains that I'm looking most forward to climb in the future. Because of these considerations, it's nice to look at a list of peaks I've done that fall into this category, which is of course the motivation for this page!!! (even though there are only 3 ultra's I've done so far lol)

        Each peak is linked to its page on peakbagger, along with its elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Note that the prominence valued displayed are of clean prominence, whereas inclusion into the list is based on optimistic prominence - that's why some of the peaks are below the prominence threshold! Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happily correct their names!!!

        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. When linked from the outside, the default is to sort by elevation, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
