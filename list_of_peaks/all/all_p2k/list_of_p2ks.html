    <h1>Vera's Climbed P2ks!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks with 2000ft of prominence that I have climbed since starting my trans-pride flag projects back in the summer of 2022!!! Peaks with 3000ft of prominence are generally regarded to be their own class of mountains in the US, and internationally around 600m of prominence is often given a similar regard. Even for those climbers who value elevation above all else, 2000ft of prominence undeniably makes for a topographically-significant peak, and as far as I'm aware, there are no elevation-based lists in the world that have a prominence cuttoff higher than this threshold. On a personal level would contend that once a peak gets 2000ft/600m of prominence, it should be considered a major summit in an area - and because of that, 2000ft prominence peaks form the foundation of my most recent peakbagging projects, and will likely form the backbone of my future peakbagging projects as well. Because of these considerations, it's nice to look at a list of peaks I've done that fall into this category, which is of course the motivation for this page!!!

        Each peak is linked to its page on peakbagger, along with its elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Note that the prominence valued displayed are of clean prominence, whereas inclusion into the list is based on optimistic prominence - that's why some of the peaks are below the prominence threshold! Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happily correct their names!!!

        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. When linked from the outside, the default is to sort by elevation, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
