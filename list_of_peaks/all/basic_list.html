    <h1>List of peaks I've climbed!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks I've climbed and brought a trans pride flag to the top of since May 8th, 2022, with each peak linked to its page on peakbagger, and with the elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happy correct their names!!!

        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. Currently, the default is sorting by prominence, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
