    <h1>Vera's Western Peaks!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks that I have climbed in the western part of North America and have taken a transgender pride flag up as part of my extended project to do that on as many peaks as I can!!! The western part of North America contains numerous diverse mountain ranges, from the Chugach to the Chisos. Even though I've only done one of these mountains so far to date, the vast majority of the peaks I intend to climb as part of my projects lie here, so I figured I would get the coding work out of the way early. Although there are more isolated peaks in the east of North America than the west, and although there are many a prominent peak out there, there is simply no fair comparison in terms of elevation above sea level, so it seems most fair to me to place these mountains in their own geographic category, which is what you can see below. For the purposes of this list, Western North America is comprised of every state and province in the US and Canada including and west of the Rockies. For sure, making this entire list for just one peak so far is aspirational, but I hope to expand it by the end of the year!

        Each peak is linked to its page on peakbagger, along with its elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Note that the prominence valued displayed are of clean prominence, whereas inclusion into the list is based on optimistic prominence - that's why some of the peaks are below the prominence threshold! Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happy correct their names!!!

        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. When linked from the outside, the default is to sort by elevation, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
