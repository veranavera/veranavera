    <h1>Vera's Eastern Peaks!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the peaks that I have climbed in the eastern part of North America and have taken a transgender pride flag up as part of my extended project to do that on as many peaks as I can!!! The eastern part of North America contains numerous diverse mountain ranges, from the Ozarks to the Adirondacks, and make up virtually all of the peaks I've climbed in my projects so far. That being said, when it comes to elevation, there is simply no way to fairly compare the mountains of the Cordierra to the scattered ranges to the east in terms of elevation or, quite frankly, prominence (although there are more isolated peaks in the east than the west - go figure). Because of this, it seems most fair to me to place these mountains in their own geographic category, which is what you can see below. For the purposes of this list, Eastern North America is comprised of every state and province in the US and Canada east of the Rockies - including the ranges of the Great Plains and Canadian Shield. For sure, hiking outside of the Appalachians still is an aspirational goal, but it's one I hope to start developing within the year - so stay tuned for that!

        Each peak is linked to its page on peakbagger, along with its elevation, prominence, isolation, and location pulled from that website. Note that the prominence valued displayed are of clean prominence, whereas inclusion into the list is based on optimistic prominence - that's why some of the peaks are below the prominence threshold! Also, each peak has the date I climbed it, and each date is linked to a trip report on this website which will include photos from the ascent - including, of course, the flag photos!!! Finally, note that I try and use an indigenous name for a mountain whenever I have that data available, so oftentimes the linked peak will show up under a different, colonial name. If you know any other indigenous names for any of these mountains, let me know and I will happily correct their names!!!

        You can feel free click on each of the table headers and get a list sorted by that parameter (isolation, date, etc.). If you click on a header twice, the list will sort in reverse order. When linked from the outside, the default is to sort by elevation, but the list also looks really cool from other perspectives!!!
